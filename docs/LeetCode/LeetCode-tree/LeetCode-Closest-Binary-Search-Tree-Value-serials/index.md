# Closest Binary Search Tree Value



## [LeetCode-270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value-Plus-Easy](https://leetcode.cn/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)



Given the `root` of a binary search tree and a `target` value, return *the value in the BST that is closest to the* `target`. If there are multiple answers, print the smallest.



## [LeetCode-272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II-Hard](https://leetcode.cn/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value-ii/)



Given the `root` of a binary search tree, a `target` value, and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *values in the BST that are closest to the* `target`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

You are **guaranteed** to have only one unique set of `k` values in the BST that are closest to the `target`.
