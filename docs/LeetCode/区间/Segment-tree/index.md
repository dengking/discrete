# Segment tree



## wikipedia [Segment tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **segment tree,** also known as a statistic tree, is a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) used for storing information about [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)), or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built. A similar data structure is the [interval tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree).
