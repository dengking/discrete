## wikipedia [Bracket (tournament)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_(tournament))

A **bracket** or **tournament bracket** is a [tree diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure) that represents the series of games played during a [knockout tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_tournament). Different knockout tournament formats have different brackets; the simplest and most common is that of the [single-elimination tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament). The name "bracket" is [American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English), derived from the resemblance of the links in the tree diagram to the [bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket) punctuation symbol ] or [ (called a "square bracket" in [British English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English)). The closest British term is **draw**, although this implies an element of chance, whereas some brackets are determined entirely by [seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)).
