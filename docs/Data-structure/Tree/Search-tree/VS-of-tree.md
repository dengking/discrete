# VS of search tree

## [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) VS [self-balancing trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)



在[Search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_tree)中有这样的一段话：

> B-trees are generalizations of binary search trees in that they can have a variable number of subtrees at each node. While child-nodes have a pre-defined range, they will not necessarily be filled with data, meaning B-trees can potentially waste some space. The advantage is that B-trees do not need to be re-balanced as frequently as other [self-balancing trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree).
