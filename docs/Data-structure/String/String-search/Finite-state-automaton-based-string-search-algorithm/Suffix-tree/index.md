## Suffix tree



### wikipedia [Suffix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree)



### gpt-4-vision Ukkonen's algorithm

Building a suffix tree is a more complex task than building a suffix array. A suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values. Suffix trees are a powerful data structure for many string processing and computational biology tasks.

Here's a basic Python implementation of a suffix tree using Ukkonen's algorithm, which builds the suffix tree in O(n) time complexity:
