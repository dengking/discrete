# wikipedia [Tree (set theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(set_theory))

In [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), a **tree** is a [partially ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) (*T*, <) such that for each *t* ∈ *T*, the set {*s* ∈ *T* : *s* < *t*} is [well-ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordered) by the relation <. Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root (i.e. [minimal element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element)), as the typical questions investigated in this field are easily reduced to questions about single-rooted trees.

## Definition

A **tree** is a [partially ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) (poset) (*T*, <) such that for each *t* ∈ *T*, the set {*s* ∈ *T* : *s* < *t*} is [well-ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordered) by the relation <. In particular, each well-ordered set (*T*, <) is a tree. For each *t* ∈ *T*, the [order type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_type) of {*s* ∈ *T* : *s* < *t*} is called the **height** of *t* (denoted ht(*t*, *T*)). The **height** of *T* itself is the least [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number) greater than the height of each element of *T*. A **root** of a tree *T* is an element of height 0. Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root. **Note that trees in set theory are often defined to grow downward making the root the greatest node.**

Trees with a single root may be viewed as rooted trees in the sense of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) in one of two ways: either as a [tree (graph theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) or as a [trivially perfect graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivially_perfect_graph). In the first case, the graph is the undirected [Hasse Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_Diagram) of the partially ordered set, and in the second case, the graph is simply the underlying (undirected) graph of the partially ordered set. However, if *T* is a tree of height > ω, then the Hasse diagram definition does not work. For example, the partially ordered set $ \omega +1=\left\{0,1,2,\dots ,\omega \right\} $ does not have a Hasse Diagram, as there is no predecessor to ω. Hence we require height at most omega in this case.

A **branch** of a tree is a maximal chain in the tree (that is, any two elements of the branch are comparable, and any element of the tree *not* in the branch is incomparable with at least one element of the branch). The **length** of a branch is the [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number) that is [order isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_isomorphism) to the branch. For each ordinal α, the **α-th level** of *T* is the set of all elements of *T* of height α. A tree is a κ-tree, for an ordinal number κ, if and only if it has height κ and every level has [size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) less than the cardinality of κ. The **width** of a tree is the supremum of the cardinalities of its levels.

Any single-rooted tree of height $ \leq \omega $ forms a meet-semilattice, where meet (common ancestor) is given by maximal element of intersection of ancestors, which exists as the set of ancestors is non-empty and finite well-ordered, hence has a maximal element. Without a single root, the intersection of parents can be empty (two elements need not have common ancestors), for example $ \left\{a,b\right\} $ where the elements are not comparable; while if there are an infinite number of ancestors there need not be a maximal element – for example, $ \left\{0,1,2,\dots ,\omega _{0},\omega _{0}'\right\} $ where $ \omega _{0},\omega _{0}' $ are not comparable.

A **subtree** of a tree $ (T,<) $ is a tree $ (T',<) $ where $ T'\subseteq T $ and $ T' $ is downward closed under $ < $, i.e., if $ s,t\in T $ and $ s<t $ then $ t\in T'\implies s\in T' $.
