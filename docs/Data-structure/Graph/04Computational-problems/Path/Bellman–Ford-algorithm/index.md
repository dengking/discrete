# Bellman–Ford algorithm

The **Bellman–Ford algorithm** is an [algorithm](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Algorithm) that computes [shortest paths](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Shortest_path) from a single source [vertex](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Vertex_(graph_theory)) to all of the other vertices in a [weighted digraph](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Weighted_digraph).[[1\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Bellman Ford#cite_note-Bang-1) It is slower than [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Dijkstra's_algorithm) for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
