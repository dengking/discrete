## wikipedia [Graph operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_operations)

**Graph operations** produce new [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) from initial ones. They may be separated into the following major categories.

### Unary operations

Unary operations create a new graph from one initial one.

### Elementary operations

Elementary operations or editing operations create a new graph from one initial one by a simple local change, such as addition or deletion of a vertex or of an edge, merging and splitting of vertices, [edge contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_contraction), etc. The [graph edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_edit_distance) between a pair of graphs is the minimum number of elementary operations required to transform one graph into the other.

### Advanced operations

Advanced operations create a new graph from one initial one by a complex changes, such as:

- [transpose graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose_graph);
- [complement graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph);
- [line graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph);
- [graph minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_minor);
- [graph rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_rewriting);
- [power of graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_graph);
- [dual graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph);
- [medial graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_graph);
- [quotient graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_graph);
- [Y-Δ transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-Δ_transform);
- [Mycielskian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycielskian).



### Binary operations

Binary operations create a new graph from two initial ones *G*1 = (*V*1, *E*1) and *G*2 = (*V*2, *E*2), such as:

1、graph union: *G*1 ∪ *G*2. There are two definitions. In the most common one, the [disjoint union of graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union_of_graphs), the union is assumed to be disjoint. Less commonly (though more consistent with the general definition of [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)) in mathematics) the union of two graphs is defined as the graph (*V*1 ∪ *V*2, *E*1 ∪ *E*2).
