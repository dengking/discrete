# A* search algorithm

stackexchange [Am I right about the differences between Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/158613/am-i-right-about-the-differences-between-floyd-warshall-dijkstras-and-bellman) # [A](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/159288) 

> Dijkstra's can be transformed easily into the A* algorithm by just changing it to stop once its found the target node and adding heuristics.
