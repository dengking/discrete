# Spanning tree



## wikipedia [Spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree)

In the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) field of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), a **spanning tree** *T* of an [undirected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undirected_graph) *G* is a subgraph that is a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) which includes all of the [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)) of *G*.

In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is not [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_graph) will not contain a spanning tree (see about [spanning forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree#Spanning_forests) below).

### Applications

Several [pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding) algorithms, including [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) and the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), internally build a spanning tree as an intermediate step in solving the problem.
