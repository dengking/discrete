## wikipedia [Floyd–Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)



The Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an example of [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), and was published in its currently recognized form by [Robert Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Floyd) in 1962.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-3) However, it is essentially the same as algorithms previously published by [Bernard Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Roy) in 1959[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-4) and also by [Stephen Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Warshall) in 1962[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-5) for finding the **transitive closure** of a graph,[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-6) and is closely related to [Kleene's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene's_algorithm) (published in 1956) for converting a [deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) into a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-7) The modern formulation of the algorithm as three nested for-loops was first described by Peter Ingerman, also in 1962.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-8)
