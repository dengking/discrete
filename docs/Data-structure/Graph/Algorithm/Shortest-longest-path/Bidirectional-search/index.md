# Bidirectional search



## wikipedia [Bidirectional search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search)

**Bidirectional search** is a [graph search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_search_algorithm) that finds a [shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path) from an initial [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)) to a goal vertex in a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph). It runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the initial state, and one backward from the goal, stopping when the two meet.
