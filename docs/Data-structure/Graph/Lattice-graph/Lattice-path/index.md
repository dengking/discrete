> $C_n$ is the number of monotonic [lattice paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_path) along the edges of a grid with *n* × *n* square cells, which do not pass above the diagonal. A monotonic path is one which starts in the lower left corner, finishes in the upper right corner, and consists entirely of edges pointing rightwards or upwards. Counting such paths is equivalent to counting Dyck words: X stands for "move right" and Y stands for "move up".
