# Discrete math and computer science

作为一个software engineer，我越来越觉得：

## [Discrete structures](http://wiki.acm.org/cs2001/index.php?title=Discrete_structures)

**Discrete structures** are foundational material for computer science. By foundational we mean that relatively few computer scientists will be working primarily on **discrete structures**, but that many other areas of computer science require the ability to work with concepts from **discrete structures**. Discrete structures include important material from such areas as set theory, logic, graph theory, and combinatorics.

The material in **discrete structures** is pervasive（普遍的） in the areas of **data structures** and **algorithms** but appears elsewhere in computer science as well. For example, an ability to create and understand a proof—either a formal symbolic proof or a less formal but still mathematically rigorous argument—is essential in formal specification, in verification, in databases, and in cryptography. Graph theory concepts are used in networks, operating systems, and compilers. Set theory concepts are used in software engineering and in databases.

As the field of computer science matures, more and more sophisticated analysis techniques are being brought to bear on practical problems. To understand the computational techniques of the future, today’s students will need a strong background in discrete structures.



## [Explain what is the role of Discrete Structures in Computer Science](https://www.quora.com/Explain-what-is-the-role-of-Discrete-Structures-in-Computer-Science#:~:text=)

**Discrete structures** is study of mathematical **structures** that are fundamentally **discrete** (that is not continuous). This is usually the first **mathematics** course for **computer science** students; it helps them to start thinking about problems in a way **computers** can solve.



## Goals of a Discrete Mathematics Course

A discrete mathematics course has more than one purpose. Students should learn a particular set of mathematical facts and how to apply them; more importantly, such a course should teach students how to think **logically** and **mathematically**. To achieve these goals, this text stresses mathematical reasoning and the different ways problems are solved. Five important themes are interwoven in this text: **mathematical reasoning**, **combinatorial analysis**, **discrete structures**, **algorithmic thinking**, and **applications and modeling**. A successful discrete mathematics course should carefully blend and balance all five themes.

### Mathematical Reasoning

Students must understand **mathematical reasoning** in order to read, comprehend, and construct mathematical arguments. This text starts with a discussion of **mathematical logic**, which serves as the foundation for the subsequent discussions of **methods of proof**. Both the science and the art of constructing proofs are addressed. The technique of **mathematical induction** is stressed through many different types of examples of such proofs and a careful explanation of why mathematical induction is a valid proof technique.

### Combinatorial Analysis

An important problem-solving skill is the ability to **count** or **enumerate** objects. The discussion of **enumeration** in this book begins with the basic techniques of **counting**. The stress is on performing **combinatorial analysis** to solve counting problems and analyze algorithms, not on applying formulae（公式）.

### Discrete Structures

A course in discrete mathematics should teach students how to work with **discrete structures**, which are the **abstract mathematical structures** used to represent discrete **objects** and **relationships** between these objects. These discrete structures include **sets**, **permutations**, **relations**, **graphs**, **trees**, and **finite-state machines**.

### Algorithmic Thinking

Certain classes of problems are solved by the specification of an algorithm. After an algorithm has been described, a computer program can be constructed implementing it. The mathematical portions of this activity, which include the specification of the algorithm, the verification that it works properly, and the analysis of the computer memory and time required to perform it,are all covered in this text. Algorithms are described using both English and an easily understood form of pseudocode.

### Applications and Modeling

Discrete mathematics has applications to almost every conceivable area of study. There are many applications to computer science and data networking in this text, as well as applications to such diverse areas as chemistry, biology, linguistics, geography, business, and the Internet. These applications are natural and important uses of discrete mathematics and are not contrived. Modeling with discrete mathematics is an extremely important problem-solving skill, which students have the opportunity to develop by constructing their own models in some of the exercises.
