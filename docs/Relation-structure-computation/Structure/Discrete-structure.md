# Discrete structure

有了[discrete](../What-is-discrete-math/Discrete-math.md)概念和[structure](./Structure.md)概念，那么理解what is discrete structure就比较容易了。下面是一些关于discrete structure的内容：



## [Explain what is the role of Discrete Structures in Computer Science](https://www.quora.com/Explain-what-is-the-role-of-Discrete-Structures-in-Computer-Science#:~:text=)

**Discrete structures** is study of mathematical **structures** that are fundamentally **discrete** (that is not continuous). This is usually the first **mathematics** course for **computer science** students; it helps them to start thinking about problems in a way **computers** can solve.

## [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/125967651X)

在这本书的[Preface](../Book-Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications/Preface.md)、[chapter 2](../Book-Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications/Chapter-2-Basic-Structures/index.md)、[chapter 9](../Book-Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications/Chpater-9-Relations/index.md)中有对discrete structure的描述。
