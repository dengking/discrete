# [Computational problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem)

In [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science), a **computational problem** is a [mathematical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object) representing a collection of questions that [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers) might be able to solve. For example, the problem of **factoring**

"Given a positive integer *n*, find a nontrivial prime factor of *n*."

is a computational problem.

**Computational problems** are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science. The field of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms) studies methods of solving **computational problems** efficiently. The complementary field of [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity) attempts to explain why certain computational problems are intractable for computers.

A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of *instances* together with a *solution* for every instance. For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers *n*, and solutions are prime numbers *p* that describe nontrivial prime factors of *n*.

It is conventional to represent both instances and solutions by binary [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), namely elements of {0, 1}*. For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using the binary encoding. (For readability, we identify numbers with their binary encodings in the examples below.)
