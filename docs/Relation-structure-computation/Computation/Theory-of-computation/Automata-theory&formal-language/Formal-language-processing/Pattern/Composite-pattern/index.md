# Composite pattern



## wikipedia [Composite pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern)

In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), the **composite pattern** is a partitioning [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)). The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern#cite_note-GangOfFour-1)
