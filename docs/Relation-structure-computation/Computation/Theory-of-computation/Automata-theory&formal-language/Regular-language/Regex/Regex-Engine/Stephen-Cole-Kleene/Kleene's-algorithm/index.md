# Kleene's algorithm

是在阅读wikipedia [Floyd–Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)，其中有这样的描述:

> However, it is essentially the same as algorithms previously published by [Bernard Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Roy) in 1959[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-4) and also by [Stephen Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Warshall) in 1962[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-5) for finding the transitive closure of a graph,[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-6) and is closely related to [Kleene's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene's_algorithm) (published in 1956) for converting a [deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) into a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#cite_note-7) 

## wikipedia [Kleene's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_algorithm)

In [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science), in particular in [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language_theory), **Kleene's algorithm** transforms a given [nondeterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) (NFA) into a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). Together with other conversion algorithms, it establishes the equivalence of several description formats for [regular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language). 

> NOTE: 
>
> 一、这个算法简而言之就是: 将 NFA转化为regex，它和 "[Thompson's construction algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson's_construction_algorithm) — transforms a regular expression to a finite automaton" 正好相反。



[Floyd–Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm#Applications_and_generalizations) — an algorithm on weighted graphs that can be implemented by Kleene's algorithm using a particular [Kleene algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_algebra#Examples)
