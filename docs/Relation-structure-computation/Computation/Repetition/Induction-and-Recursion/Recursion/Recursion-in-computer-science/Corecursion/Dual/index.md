## wikipedia [Duality (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics))

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), a **duality** translates concepts, [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem) or [mathematical structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure) into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a [one-to-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function) function, often (but not always) by means of an [involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)) operation: if the dual of *A* is *B*, then the dual of *B* is *A*. Such involutions sometimes have [fixed points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)), so that the dual of *A* is *A* itself.
