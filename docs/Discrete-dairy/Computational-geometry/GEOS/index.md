# GEOS

在阅读 wikipedia [JTS Topology Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTS_Topology_Suite) 的时候，其中提及了:

> In addition to the Java library, the foundations of JTS and selected functions are maintained in a C++ port, for use in C-style linking on all major operating systems, in the form of the **GEOS** software library.
>
> Up to JTS 1.14, and the GEOS port, are published under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) (LGPL).
