# Induction & Deduction

在阅读中经常碰到这两个词语，“induction”即“归纳”，“deduction”即“演绎”，有必要对它们进行总结。

## [Deduction & Induction](https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb/deduction-and-induction/)

In logic, we often refer to the two broad methods of reasoning as the ***deductive*** and ***inductive*** approaches.

两者都是“推理”的方法。

**Deductive reasoning** works from the more general to the more specific. Sometimes this is informally called a “top-down” approach.

**Inductive reasoning** works the other way, moving from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories. Informally, we sometimes call this a “bottom up” approach (please note that it’s “bottom up” and *not* “bottom**s** up” which is the kind of thing the bartender says to customers when he’s trying to close for the night!).
