# [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics)

**Combinatorics** is an area of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) primarily concerned with counting（计数）, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set) [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure)（有限结构）. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) to [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics), from [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology) to [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), etc.

To fully understand the scope of **combinatorics** requires a great deal of further amplification（放大）, the details of which are not universally agreed upon.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#cite_note-1) According to [H.J. Ryser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.J._Ryser), a definition of the subject is difficult because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#cite_note-2) Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with

- the *enumeration* (counting) of specified structures, sometimes referred to as arrangements or configurations in a very general sense, associated with finite systems,
- the *existence* of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria,
- the *construction* of these structures, perhaps in many ways, and
- *optimization*, finding the "best" structure or solution among several possibilities, be it the "largest", "smallest" or satisfying some other optimality criterion.

[Leon Mirsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Mirsky) has said: "combinatorics is a range of linked studies which have something in common and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, and the degree of coherence they have attained."[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#cite_note-3) One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#cite_note-4) Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, [countable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set)) but [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics) setting.

Combinatorics is well known for the breadth of the problems it tackles. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics), notably in [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra), [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology), and [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry),[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#cite_note-5) as well as in its many application areas. Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an *ad hoc* solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#cite_note-6) One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), which by itself has numerous natural connections to other areas. Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the [analysis of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms).

A [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician) who studies combinatorics is called a *combinatorialist*.





## Approaches and subfields of combinatorics

### Enumerative combinatorics

 *Main article:* [Enumerative combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_combinatorics) 

Enumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics and concentrates on counting the number of certain **combinatorial objects**. Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad [mathematical problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_problem), many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers) is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics. The [twelvefold way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelvefold_way) provides a unified framework for counting [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutations), [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinations) and [partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set).

 Five [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) on three [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)), an example of [Catalan numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number). 

### Analytic combinatorics

 *Main article:* [Analytic combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_combinatorics) 

 [Analytic combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_combinatorics) concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from [complex analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis) and [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory). In contrast with enumerative combinatorics, which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and [generating functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_functions) to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining [asymptotic formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis). 

### Partition theory

 *Main article:* [Partition theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) 

 Partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to [integer partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_partition), and is closely related to [q-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-series), [special functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions) and [orthogonal polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials). Originally a part of [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) and [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis), it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field. It incorporates the [bijective approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_proof) and various tools in analysis and [analytic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory)and has connections with [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics).

### Combinatorial optimization

 [Combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization) is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research), [algorithm theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) and [computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory).
