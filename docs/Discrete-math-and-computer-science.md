# Discrete math and computer science

正如在维基百科[Discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics)中所述：

> Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), such as [computer algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algorithm), [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), [automated theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving), and [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development). Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research).

作为一个software engineer，对上面这段话的感受越来越深刻，总的来说，我越来越觉得：

> Computer science is discrete.
