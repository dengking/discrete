### Combinatorial computational geometry

The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) and [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, [polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon), [polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron), etc.



### Numerical computational geometry

This branch is also known as **geometric modelling** and **computer-aided geometric design** (CAGD).
