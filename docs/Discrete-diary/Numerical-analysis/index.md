## wikipedia [Numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis)

**Numerical analysis** is the study of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that use numerical [approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation) (as opposed to [symbolic manipulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation)) for the problems of [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis) (as distinguished from [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics)).

It is the study of **numerical methods** that attempt at finding approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones.

Examples of numerical analysis include: 

1縲ーordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) as found in [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics) (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies), 

2縲ーnumerical linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_linear_algebra) in data analysis,[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis#cite_note-3)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis#cite_note-4) 

3縲ーstochastic differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation) 

3縲ーMarkov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) for simulating living cells in medicine and biology.
