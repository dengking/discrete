# Static、dynamic data structure

是在阅读 wikipedia  [Computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) 时其中有关于dynamic data structure的描述:

> Yet another major class is the [dynamic problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_problem_(algorithms)), in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data (addition or deletion input geometric elements). Algorithms for problems of this type typically involve [dynamic data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_data_structures).
