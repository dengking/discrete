## wikipedia [Dancing Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **dancing links** (**DLX**) is a technique for adding and deleting a node from a circular [doubly linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list). It is particularly useful for efficiently implementing [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) algorithms, such as [Knuth's Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth's_Algorithm_X) for the [exact cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover_problem).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links#cite_note-1) Algorithm X is a [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)), [nondeterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm), [depth-first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first), [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that finds all solutions to the [exact cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) problem. Some of the better-known exact cover problems include [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation), the [*n* queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), and [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

The name *dancing links*, which was suggested by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), stems from the way the algorithm works, as iterations of the algorithm cause the links to "dance" with partner links so as to resemble an "exquisitely choreographed dance." Knuth credits Hiroshi Hitotsumatsu and Kōhei Noshita with having invented the idea in 1979,[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links#cite_note-2) but it is his paper which has popularized it.
