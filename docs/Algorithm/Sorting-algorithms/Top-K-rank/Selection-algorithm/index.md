# Selection algorithm



## wikipedia [Selection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **selection algorithm** is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for finding the `k`th smallest value in a collection of ordered values, such as numbers. The value that it finds is called the �![k](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40)th [order statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic). Selection includes as special cases the problems of finding the [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum), [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median), and [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum) element in the collection. Selection algorithms include [quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect), and the [median of medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians) algorithm. When applied to a collection of �![n](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b) values, these algorithms take [linear time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time), �(�)![O(n)](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34109fe397fdcff370079185bfdb65826cb5565a) as expressed using [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). For data that is already structured, faster algorithms may be possible; as an extreme case, selection in an already-sorted [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)) takes time �(1)
