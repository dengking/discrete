# wikipedia [Algorithmic paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_paradigm)

An **algorithmic paradigm** or **algorithm design paradigm** is a generic model or framework which underlies(称为...的基础) the design of a class of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm). An algorithmic [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm) is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program). [[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_paradigm#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_paradigm#cite_note-2) Examples of algorithmic paradigms include the [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) in [optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem), [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), [prune and search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prune_and_search), and [divide and conquer algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithms). More specialized algorithmic paradigms used in [parameterized complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity) include [kernelization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernelization) and [iterative compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_compression). In [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry), additional algorithmic paradigms include [sweep line algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm), [rotating calipers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_calipers), and [randomized incremental construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm#Randomized_incremental_constructions_in_geometry).
