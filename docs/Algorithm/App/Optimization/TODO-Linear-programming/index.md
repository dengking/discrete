## wikipedia [Linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming)



**Linear programming** (**LP**, also called **linear optimization**) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) whose requirements are represented by [linear relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function#As_a_polynomial_function). Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization)).

More formally, linear programming is a technique for the [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) of a [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear) [objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function), subject to [linear equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equality) and [linear inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_inequality) [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)). Its [feasible region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) is a [convex polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope), which is a set defined as the [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(mathematics)) of finitely many [half spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-space_(geometry)), each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Its objective function is a [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number)-valued [affine (linear) function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_function) defined on this polyhedron. A linear programming [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) finds a point in the polyhedron where this function has the smallest (or largest) value if such a point exists.
