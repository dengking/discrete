*Distribution sort* refers to any sorting algorithm where data are distributed from their input to multiple intermediate structures which are then gathered and placed on the output. For example, both [bucket sort](https://infogalactic.com/info/Bucket_sort) and [flashsort](https://infogalactic.com/info/Flashsort) are distribution based sorting algorithms. Distribution sorting algorithms can be used on a single processor, or they can be a [distributed algorithm](https://infogalactic.com/info/Distributed_algorithm), where individual subsets are separately sorted on different processors, then combined. This allows [external sorting](https://infogalactic.com/info/External_sorting) of data too large to fit into a single computer's memory.
