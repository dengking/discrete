# Completeness 

"completeness"是search algorithm中一个非常重要的概念，维基百科[Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)中对它的解释是：

> Unlike general metaheuristics, which at best work only in a probabilistic sense, many of these tree-search methods are guaranteed to find the exact or optimal solution, if given enough time. This is called "[completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic))".

它并没有给出准确的描述，"[completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic))"所链接到的是维基百科[Completeness (logic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic))，这篇文章是不易理解的。下面是一些分析：

## [What is meant by search algorithm completeness?](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mack/CS322/exercises/1_ex_search_uninformed_sol.pdf)

If an algorithm is complete, it means that if at least one solution exists then the algorithm is guaranteed find a solution in a finite amount of time.
