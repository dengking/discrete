 In [combinatorial mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), **Catalan's triangle** is a [number triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_triangle) whose entries $ C(n,k) $ give the number of strings consisting of *n* X's and *k* Y's such that no initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's. It is a generalization of the [Catalan numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_numbers), and is named after [Eugène Charles Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugène_Charles_Catalan). Bailey[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan's_triangle#cite_note-Bailey1996-1) shows that $ C(n,k) $ satisfy the following properties: 

1. $ C(n,0)=1{\text{ for }}n\geq 0 $.
2. $ C(n,1)=n{\text{ for }}n\geq 1 $.
3. $ C(n+1,k)=C(n+1,k-1)+C(n,k){\text{ for }}1<k<n+1 $
4. $ C(n+1,n+1)=C(n+1,n){\text{ for }}n\geq 1 $.
