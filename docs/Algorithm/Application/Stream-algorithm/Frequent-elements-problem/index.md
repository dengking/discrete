## wikipedia [Streaming algorithm # Frequent elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm#Frequent_elements)

In the data stream model, the **frequent elements problem** is to output a set of elements that constitute more than some fixed fraction of the stream. A special case is the **majority problem**, which is to determine whether or not any value constitutes a majority of the stream.

Some notable algorithms are:
