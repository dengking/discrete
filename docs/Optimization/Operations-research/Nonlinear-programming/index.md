# Nonlinear programming



## wikipedia [Nonlinear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming)

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), **nonlinear programming** (**NLP**) is the process of solving an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) where some of the constraints or the objective function are [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear). 

An [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) is one of calculation of the extrema (maxima, minima or stationary points) of an [objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function) over a set of unknown [real variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_a_real_variable) and conditional to the satisfaction of a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equations) of [equalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation) and [inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)), collectively termed [constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)). It is the sub-field of [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) that deals with problems that are not linear.

A nonlinear minimization problem is an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) of the form
$$
{\begin{aligned}{\text{minimize }}&f(x)\\{\text{subject to }}&g_{i}(x)\leq 0{\text{ for each }}i\in \{1,\dotsc ,m\}\\&h_{j}(x)=0{\text{ for each }}j\in \{1,\dotsc ,p\}\\&x\in X.\end{aligned}}
$$
