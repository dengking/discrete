Optimization problems can be divided into two categories depending on whether the variables are continuous or discrete . An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a discrete optimization . In a discrete optimization problem, we are looking for an object such as an integer , permutation or graph from a countable set . A problem with continuous variables is known as a continuous optimization , in which an optimal value from a continuous function must be found. They can include constrained problems and multimodal problems.

If $ m $ and $ p $ equal 0, the problem is an unconstrained optimization problem. By convention, the standard form defines a minimization problem . A maximization problem can be treated by negating the objective function. Combinatorial optimization problem Main article: Combinatorial optimization Formally, a combinatorial optimization problem $ A $ is a quadruple[ citation needed ] $ (I,f,m,g) $, where $ I $ is a set of instances; given an instance $ x\\in I $, $ f(x) $ is the set of feasible solutions; given an instance $ x $ and a feasible solution $ y $ of $ x $, $ m(x,y) $ denotes the measure of $ y $, which is usually a positive real . $ g $ is the goal function, and is either $ \\min $ or $ \\max $. The goal is then to find for some instance $ x $ an optimal solution , that is, a feasible solution $ y $ with $$ m(x,y)=g{\\bigl {}m(x,y')\\mid y'\\in f(x){\\bigr }} $$ For each combinatorial optimization problem, there is a corresponding decision problem that asks whether there is a feasible solution for some particular measure $ m_{0} $. For example, if there is a graph $ G $ which contains vertices $ u $ and $ v $, an optimization problem might be \"find a path from $ u $ to $ v $ that uses the fewest edges\". This problem might have an answer of, say, 4. A corresponding decision problem would be \"is there a path from $ u $ to $ v $ that uses 10 or fewer edges?\" This problem can be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'.

For instance, as shown below, the number of different possible orderings of a deck of n cards is f ( n ) = n !. The problem of finding a closed formula is known as algebraic enumeration , and frequently involves deriving a recurrence relation or generating function and using this to arrive at the desired closed form. Often, a complicated closed formula yields little insight into the behavior of the counting function as the number of counted objects grows. In these cases, a simple asymptotic approximation may be preferable. A function $ g(n) $ is an asymptotic approximation to $ f(n) $ if $ f(n)/g(n)\\rightarrow 1 $ as $ n\\rightarrow \\infty $. In this case, we write $ f(n)\\sim g(n).\\, $ Generating functions Generating functions are used to describe families of combinatorial objects. Let $ {\\mathcal {F}} $ denote the family of objects and let F ( x ) be its generating function. Then $ F(x)=\\sum {n=0}^{\\infty }f {n}x^{n} $ where $ f_{n} $ denotes the number of combinatorial objects of size n . The number of combinatorial objects of size n is therefore given by the coefficient of $ x^{n} $. Some common operation on families of combinatorial objects and its effect on the generating function will now be developed. The exponential generating function is also sometimes used. In this case it would have the form $ F(x)=\\sum {n=0}^{\\infty }f {n}{\\frac {x^{n}}{n!}} $ Once determined, the generating function yields the information given by the previous approaches. In addition, the various natural operations on generating functions such as addition, multiplication, differentiation, etc., have a combinatorial significance; this allows one to extend results from one combinatorial problem in order to solve others. Union Given two combinatorial families, $ {\\mathcal {F}} $ and $ {\\mathcal {G}} $ with generating functions F ( x ) and G ( x ) respectively, the disjoint union of the two families ($ {\\mathcal {F}}\\cup {\\mathcal {G}} $) has generating function F ( x ) + G ( x ). Pairs For two combinatorial families as above the Cartesian product (pair) of the two families ($ {\\mathcal {F}}\\times {\\mathcal {G}} $) has generating function F ( x ) G ( x ). Sequences A sequence generalizes the idea of the pair as defined above. Sequences are arbitrary Cartesian products of a combinatorial object with itself. Formally: $ {\\mbox{Seq}}({\\mathcal {F}})=\\epsilon \\cup {\\mathcal {F}} \\cup {\\mathcal {F}}\\times {\\mathcal {F}} \\cup {\\mathcal {F}}\\times {\\mathcal {F}}\\times {\\mathcal {F}} \\cup \\cdots $ To put the above in words: An empty sequence or a sequence of one element or a sequence of two elements or a sequence of three elements, etc. The generating function would be: $ 1+F(x)+[F(x)] {2}+[F(x)] {3}+\\cdots ={\\frac {1}{1-F(x)}} $ Combinatorial structures The above operations can now be used to enumerate common combinatorial objects including trees (binary and plane), Dyck paths and cycles. A combinatorial structure is composed of atoms. For example, with trees the atoms would be the nodes. The atoms which compose the object can either be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled atoms are indistinguishable from each other, while labelled atoms are distinct. Therefore, for a combinatorial object consisting of labeled atoms a new object can be formed by simply swapping two or more atoms. Binary and plane trees Binary and plane trees are examples of an unlabeled combinatorial structure. Trees consist of nodes linked by edges in such a way that there are no cycles. There is generally a node called the root, which has no parent node. In Plane trees each node can have an arbitrary number of children. In binary trees, a special case of plane trees, each node can have either two or no children. Let $ {\\mathcal {P}} $ denote the family of all plane trees. Then this family can be recursively defined as follows: $ {\\mathcal {P}}={\\bullet }\\times {\\mbox{Seq}}({\\mathcal {P}}) $ In this case $ {\\bullet } $ represents the family of objects consisting of one node. This has generating function x . Let P ( x ) denote the generating function $ {\\mathcal {P}} $. Putting the above description in words: A plane tree consists of a node to which is attached an arbitrary number of subtrees, each of which is also a plane tree. Using the operation on families of combinatorial structures developed earlier this translates to a recursive generating function: $ P(x)=x{\\frac {1}{1-P(x)}} $ After solving for P ( x ): $ P(x)={\\frac {1-{\\sqrt {1-4x}}}{2}} $ An explicit formula for the number of plane trees of size n can now be determined by extracting the coefficient of x^n x^n . $ {\\begin{aligned}p_{n}&=[x {n}]P(x)=[x {n}]{\\frac {1-{\\sqrt {1-4x}}}{2}}\\[6pt]&=[x^{n}]{\\frac {1}{2}}-[x^{n}]{\\frac {1}{2}}{\\sqrt {1-4x}}\\[6pt]&=-{\\frac {1}{2}}[x^{n}]\\sum _{k=0}^{\\infty }{{\\frac {1}{2}} \\choose k}(-4x)^{k}\\[6pt]&=-{\\frac {1}{2}}{{\\frac {1}{2}} \\choose n}(-4)^{n}\\[6pt]&={\\frac {1}{n}}{2n-2 \\choose n-1}\\end{aligned}} $ Note: The notation [ x**n ] f ( x ) refers to the coefficient of x**n in f ( x ). The series expansion of the square root is based on Newton's generalization of the binomial theorem . To get from the fourth to fifth line manipulations using the generalized binomial coefficient is needed. The expression on the last line is equal to the ( n \u2212 1)th Catalan number . Therefore p**n = c**n \u22121.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Algorithm/Application/Optimization/Combinatorial-optimization/Combinatorics/Enumerative-combinatorics/#enumerative#combinatorics","text":"Enumerative combinatorics is an area of combinatorics that deals with the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed.

For instance, as shown below, the number of different possible orderings of a deck of n cards is f ( n ) = n !. The problem of finding a closed formula is known as algebraic enumeration , and frequently involves deriving a recurrence relation or generating function and using this to arrive at the desired closed form. Often, a complicated closed formula yields little insight into the behavior of the counting function as the number of counted objects grows. In these cases, a simple asymptotic approximation may be preferable. A function $ g(n) $ is an asymptotic approximation to $ f(n) $ if $ f(n)/g(n)\\rightarrow 1 $ as $ n\\rightarrow \\infty $. In this case, we write $ f(n)\\sim g(n).\\, $","title":"Enumerative combinatorics"},{"location":"Algorithm/Application/Optimization/Combinatorial-optimization/Combinatorics/Enumerative-combinatorics/#generating#functions","text":"Generating functions are used to describe families of combinatorial objects.

The number of combinatorial objects of size n is therefore given by the coefficient of $ x^{n} $.

If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case , making $ O(\\log n) $ comparisons, where $ n $ is the number of elements in the array, the $ O $ is Big O notation , and $ \\log $ is the logarithm .[ 6] Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables , that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array. There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in computational geometry and in numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.

Some implementations leave out this check during each iteration. The algorithm would perform this check only when one element is left (when $ L=R $). This results in a faster comparison loop, as one comparison is eliminated per iteration.

Duplicate elements The procedure may return any index whose element is equal to the target value, even if there are duplicate elements in the array. For example, if the array to be searched was $ [1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7] $ and the target was $ 4 $, then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4 th (index 3) or 5 th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4 th element (index 3) in this case. It does not always return the first duplicate (consider $ [1,2,4,4,4,5,6,7] $ which still returns the 4 th element). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element for a target value that is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4 th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5 th element is the rightmost element of the value 4. The alternative procedure above will always return the index of the rightmost element if such an element exists.[ 9] , subsection \"History_and_bibliography\"-9) Procedure for finding the leftmost element To find the leftmost element, the following procedure can be used:[ 10] Set $ L $ to $ 0 $ and $ R $ to $ n $. While $ L<R $ , Set $ m $ (the position of the middle element) to the floor of $ {\\frac {L+R}{2}} $, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to $ {\\frac {L+R}{2}} $.

Even if $ T $ is not in the array, $ L $ is the rank of $ T $ in the array, or the number of elements in the array that are less than $ T $. Where floor is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is: function binary_search_leftmost(A, n, T): L := 0 R := n while L < R: m := floor((L + R) / 2) if A[m] < T: L := m + 1 else: R := m return L Procedure for finding the rightmost element To find the rightmost element, the following procedure can be used:[ 10] Set $ L $ to $ 0 $ and $ R $ to $ n $.

If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case , making $ O(\\log n) $ comparisons, where $ n $ is the number of elements in the array, the $ O $ is Big O notation , and $ \\log $ is the logarithm .[ 6] Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables , that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array. There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in computational geometry and in numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.","title":"wikipedia Binary search algorithm"},{"location":"Algorithm/Binary-search/wikipedia-Binary-search-algorithm/#algorithm","text":"","title":"Algorithm"},{"location":"Algorithm/Binary-search/wikipedia-Binary-search-algorithm/#procedure","text":"function binary_search(A, n, T): L := 0 R := n \u2212 1 while L <= R: m := floor((L + R) / 2) if A[m] < T: L := m + 1 else if A[m] > T: R := m - 1 else: return m return unsuccessful","title":"Procedure"},{"location":"Algorithm/Binary-search/wikipedia-Binary-search-algorithm/#alternative#procedure","text":"In the above procedure, the algorithm checks whether the middle element ($ m ) is **equal to** the target ( ) is **equal to** the target ( T $) in every iteration.

It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical \uff08\u9525\u5f62\uff09 shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n \u2212 1 2^n \u2212 1 , where n is the number of disks. Solution The puzzle can be played with any number of disks, although many toy versions have around 7 to 9 of them.

When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction. For example, if you started with three pieces, you would move the smallest piece to the opposite end, then continue in the left direction after that. When the turn is to move the non-smallest piece, there is only one legal move. Doing this will complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.[ 6] Recursive solution The key to solving a problem recursively is to recognize that it can be broken down into a collection of smaller sub-problems, to each of which that same general solving procedure that we are seeking applies, and the total solution is then found in some simple way from those sub-problems' solutions. Each of thus created sub-problems being \"smaller\" guarantees that the base case(s) will eventually be reached. Thence, for the Towers of Hanoi: label the pegs A, B, C, let n be the total number of disks, number the disks from 1 (smallest, topmost) to n (largest, bottom-most). Assuming all n disks are distributed in valid arrangements among the pegs; assuming there are m top disks on a source peg, and all the rest of the disks are larger than m , so they can be safely ignored; to move m disks from a source peg to a target peg using a spare peg, without violating the rules: Move m \u2212 1 disks from the source to the spare peg, by the same general solving procedure . Rules are not violated, by assumption. This leaves the disk m as a top disk on the source peg. Move the disk m from the source to the target peg, which is guaranteed to be a valid move, by the assumptions \u2014 a simple step . Move the m \u2212 1 disks that we have just placed on the spare, from the spare to the target peg by the same general solving procedure , so they are placed on top of the disk m without violating the rules. The base case being to move 0 disks (in steps 1 and 3), that is, do nothing \u2013 which obviously doesn't violate the rules. The full Tower of Hanoi solution then consists of moving n disks from the source peg A to the target peg C, using B as the spare peg. This approach can be given a rigorous mathematical proof with mathematical induction and is often used as an example of recursion when teaching programming. Logical analysis of the recursive solution As in many mathematical puzzles, finding a solution is made easier by solving a slightly more general problem: how to move a tower of h (height) disks from a starting peg f = A (from) onto a destination peg t = C (to), B being the remaining third peg and assuming t \u2260 f . First, observe that the problem is symmetric for permutations of the names of the pegs ( symmetric group *S*3 ). If a solution is known moving from peg A to peg C , then, by renaming the pegs, the same solution can be used for every other choice of starting and destination peg. If there is only one disk (or even none at all), the problem is trivial. If h = 1, then simply move the disk from peg A to peg C . If h > 1, then somewhere along the sequence of moves, the largest disk must be moved from peg A to another peg, preferably to peg C . The only situation that allows this move is when all smaller h \u2212 1 disks are on peg B . Hence, first all h \u2212 1 smaller disks must go from A to B . Then move the largest disk and finally move the h \u2212 1 smaller disks from peg B**to peg **C . The presence of the largest disk does not impede any move of the h \u2212 1 smaller disks and can be temporarily ignored. Now the problem is reduced to moving h \u2212 1 disks from one peg to another one, first from A to B and subsequently from B to C , but the same method can be used both times by renaming the pegs. The same strategy can be used to reduce the h \u2212 1 problem to h \u2212 2, h \u2212 3, and so on until only one disk is left. This is called recursion. This algorithm can be schematized as follows. Identify the disks in order of increasing size by the natural numbers from 0 up to but not including h . Hence disk 0 is the smallest one, and disk h \u2212 1 the largest one. The following is a procedure for moving a tower of h disks from a peg A onto a peg C , with B being the remaining third peg: If h > 1, then first use this procedure to move the h \u2212 1 smaller disks from peg A to peg B . Now the largest disk, i.e. disk h can be moved from peg A to peg C . If h > 1, then again use this procedure to move the h \u2212 1 smaller disks from peg B to peg C . By means of mathematical induction , it is easily proven that the above procedure requires the minimal number of moves possible, and that the produced solution is the only one with this minimal number of moves. Using recurrence relations , the exact number of moves that this solution requires can be calculated by: $ 2^{h}-1 $. This result is obtained by noting that steps 1 and 3 take $ T_{h-1} $ moves, and step 2 takes one move, giving $ T_{h}=2T_{h-1}+1 $.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: Only one disk can be moved at a time. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction. For example, if you started with three pieces, you would move the smallest piece to the opposite end, then continue in the left direction after that. When the turn is to move the non-smallest piece, there is only one legal move. Doing this will complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.[ 6]","title":"Iterative solution"},{"location":"Algorithm/Classical/Tower-of-Hanoi/#recursive#solution","text":"The key to solving a problem recursively is to recognize that it can be broken down into a collection of smaller sub-problems, to each of which that same general solving procedure that we are seeking applies, and the total solution is then found in some simple way from those sub-problems' solutions. Each of thus created sub-problems being \"smaller\" guarantees that the base case(s) will eventually be reached. Thence, for the Towers of Hanoi: label the pegs A, B, C, let n be the total number of disks, number the disks from 1 (smallest, topmost) to n (largest, bottom-most). Assuming all n disks are distributed in valid arrangements among the pegs; assuming there are m top disks on a source peg, and all the rest of the disks are larger than m , so they can be safely ignored; to move m disks from a source peg to a target peg using a spare peg, without violating the rules: Move m \u2212 1 disks from the source to the spare peg, by the same general solving procedure . Rules are not violated, by assumption. This leaves the disk m as a top disk on the source peg. Move the disk m from the source to the target peg, which is guaranteed to be a valid move, by the assumptions \u2014 a simple step . Move the m \u2212 1 disks that we have just placed on the spare, from the spare to the target peg by the same general solving procedure , so they are placed on top of the disk m without violating the rules. The base case being to move 0 disks (in steps 1 and 3), that is, do nothing \u2013 which obviously doesn't violate the rules. The full Tower of Hanoi solution then consists of moving n disks from the source peg A to the target peg C, using B as the spare peg. This approach can be given a rigorous mathematical proof with mathematical induction and is often used as an example of recursion when teaching programming.","title":"Recursive solution"},{"location":"Algorithm/Classical/Tower-of-Hanoi/#logical#analysis#of#the#recursive#solution","text":"As in many mathematical puzzles, finding a solution is made easier by solving a slightly more general problem: how to move a tower of h (height) disks from a starting peg f = A (from) onto a destination peg t = C (to), B being the remaining third peg and assuming t \u2260 f . First, observe that the problem is symmetric for permutations of the names of the pegs ( symmetric group *S*3 ). If a solution is known moving from peg A to peg C , then, by renaming the pegs, the same solution can be used for every other choice of starting and destination peg. If there is only one disk (or even none at all), the problem is trivial. If h = 1, then simply move the disk from peg A to peg C . If h > 1, then somewhere along the sequence of moves, the largest disk must be moved from peg A to another peg, preferably to peg C . The only situation that allows this move is when all smaller h \u2212 1 disks are on peg B . Hence, first all h \u2212 1 smaller disks must go from A to B . Then move the largest disk and finally move the h \u2212 1 smaller disks from peg B**to peg **C . The presence of the largest disk does not impede any move of the h \u2212 1 smaller disks and can be temporarily ignored. Now the problem is reduced to moving h \u2212 1 disks from one peg to another one, first from A to B and subsequently from B to C , but the same method can be used both times by renaming the pegs. The same strategy can be used to reduce the h \u2212 1 problem to h \u2212 2, h \u2212 3, and so on until only one disk is left. This is called recursion. This algorithm can be schematized as follows. Identify the disks in order of increasing size by the natural numbers from 0 up to but not including h . Hence disk 0 is the smallest one, and disk h \u2212 1 the largest one. The following is a procedure for moving a tower of h disks from a peg A onto a peg C , with B being the remaining third peg: If h > 1, then first use this procedure to move the h \u2212 1 smaller disks from peg A to peg B . Now the largest disk, i.e. disk h can be moved from peg A to peg C . If h > 1, then again use this procedure to move the h \u2212 1 smaller disks from peg B to peg C .

abstract problem: given a linear sequence of objects, an associative binary operation on those objects, and a way to compute the cost of performing that operation on any two given objects (as well as all partial results), compute the minimum cost way to group the objects to apply the operation over the sequence.[ 5] One somewhat contrived special case of this is string concatenation of a list of strings. In C , for example, the cost of concatenating two strings of length m and n using strcat is O( m + n ), since we need O( m ) time to find the end of the first string and O( n ) time to copy the second string onto the end of it. Using this cost function, we can write a dynamic programming algorithm to find the fastest way to concatenate a sequence of strings.

In C , for example, the cost of concatenating two strings of length m and n using strcat is O( m + n ), since we need O( m ) time to find the end of the first string and O( n ) time to copy the second string onto the end of it. Using this cost function, we can write a dynamic programming algorithm to find the fastest way to concatenate a sequence of strings.

The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering \uff08\u822a\u5929\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09 to economics . In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems \uff08\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff09 cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems , then it is said to have optimal substructure \uff08\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff09. If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.[ 1] In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation . Overview Mathematical optimization In terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of value functions V*1, *V*2, ..., *V**n taking y as an argument representing the state of the system at times i from 1 to n . The definition of V**n ( y ) is the value obtained in state y at the last time n . The values V**i at earlier times i = n \u22121, n \u2212 2, ..., 2, 1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation . For i = 2, ..., n , V**i \u22121 at any state y is calculated from V**i by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time i \u2212 1 and the function V**i at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since V**i has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields V**i \u22121 for those states. Finally, *V*1 at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed. Computer programming There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems . If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called \" divide and conquer \" instead.[ 1] This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems. SUMMARY : sorting\u5e76\u4e0d\u5177\u5907 overlapping sub-problems \u7684\u7279\u6027\uff1b Optimal substructure means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems . Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion . For example, given a graph G=(V,E) , the shortest path p from a vertex u to a vertex v exhibits optimal substructure : take any intermediate vertex w on this shortest path p . If p is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths p1 from u to w and p2 from w to v such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in Introduction to Algorithms ). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm or the Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm does. Overlapping sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: F_i = F_{i\u22121} + F_{i\u22122} F_i = F_{i\u22121} + F_{i\u22122} , with base case F_1 = F_2 = 1 F_1 = F_2 = 1 . Then F_{43} = F_{42} + F_{41} F_{43} = F_{42} + F_{41} , and F_{42} = F_{41} + F_{40} F_{42} = F_{41} + F_{40} . Now F_{41} F_{41} is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both F_{43} F_{43} as well as F_{42} F_{42} . Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once. Figure 2. This can be achieved in either of two ways:[ citation needed ] Top-down approach : This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table. Bottom-up approach : Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of *F*41 and *F*40, we can directly calculate the value of *F*42. Some programming languages can automatically memoize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as call-by-need ). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. Scheme , Common Lisp , Perl or D ). Some languages have automatic memoization built in, such as tabled Prolog and J , which supports memoization with the M. adverb.[ 4] In any case, this is only possible for a referentially transparent function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as Wolfram Language .

The values V**i at earlier times i = n \u22121, n \u2212 2, ..., 2, 1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation . For i = 2, ..., n , V**i \u22121 at any state y is calculated from V**i by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time i \u2212 1 and the function V**i at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since V**i has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields V**i \u22121 for those states. Finally, *V*1 at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.","title":"Mathematical optimization"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#computer#programming","text":"There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems . If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called \" divide and conquer \" instead.[ 1] This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems. SUMMARY : sorting\u5e76\u4e0d\u5177\u5907 overlapping sub-problems \u7684\u7279\u6027\uff1b Optimal substructure means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems . Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion . For example, given a graph G=(V,E) , the shortest path p from a vertex u to a vertex v exhibits optimal substructure : take any intermediate vertex w on this shortest path p . If p is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths p1 from u to w and p2 from w to v such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in Introduction to Algorithms ). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm or the Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm does. Overlapping sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: F_i = F_{i\u22121} + F_{i\u22122} F_i = F_{i\u22121} + F_{i\u22122} , with base case F_1 = F_2 = 1 F_1 = F_2 = 1 . Then F_{43} = F_{42} + F_{41} F_{43} = F_{42} + F_{41} , and F_{42} = F_{41} + F_{40} F_{42} = F_{41} + F_{40} . Now F_{41} F_{41} is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both F_{43} F_{43} as well as F_{42} F_{42} . Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once. Figure 2. This can be achieved in either of two ways:[ citation needed ] Top-down approach : This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table. Bottom-up approach : Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of *F*41 and *F*40, we can directly calculate the value of *F*42. Some programming languages can automatically memoize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as call-by-need ). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. Scheme , Common Lisp , Perl or D ). Some languages have automatic memoization built in, such as tabled Prolog and J , which supports memoization with the M. adverb.[ 4] In any case, this is only possible for a referentially transparent function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as Wolfram Language .","title":"Computer programming"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#examples#computer#algorithms","text":"","title":"Examples: Computer algorithms"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#dijkstras#algorithm#for#the#shortest#path#problem","text":"","title":"Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#fibonacci#sequence","text":"","title":"Fibonacci sequence"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#a#type#of#balanced#01#matrix","text":"","title":"A type of balanced 0\u20131 matrix"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#checkerboard","text":"","title":"Checkerboard"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#sequence#alignment","text":"","title":"Sequence alignment"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#tower#of#hanoi#puzzle","text":"","title":"Tower of Hanoi puzzle"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#egg#dropping#puzzle","text":"","title":"Egg dropping puzzle"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#matrix#chain#multiplication","text":"Main article: Matrix chain multiplication","title":"Matrix chain multiplication"},{"location":"Algorithm/Paradigm/DP%26Greedy/DP/wikipedia-Dynamic-programming/#algorithms#that#use#dynamic#programming","text":"Recurrent solutions to lattice models for protein-DNA binding Backward induction as a solution method for finite-horizon discrete-time dynamic optimization problems Method of undetermined coefficients can be used to solve the Bellman equation in infinite-horizon, discrete-time, discounted , time-invariant dynamic optimization problems Many string algorithms including longest common subsequence , longest increasing subsequence , longest common substring , Levenshtein distance (edit distance) Many algorithmic problems on graphs can be solved efficiently for graphs of bounded treewidth or bounded clique-width by using dynamic programming on a tree decomposition of the graph.

This is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream. Let us understand prefix codes with a counter example. Let there be four characters a , b , c and d , and their corresponding variable length codes be 00 , 01 , 0 and 1 . This coding leads to ambiguity because code assigned to c is the prefix of codes assigned to a and b . If the compressed bit stream is 0001 , the de-compressed output may be \u201ccccd\u201d or \u201cccb\u201d or \u201cacd\u201d or \u201cab\u201d.See this for applications of Huffman Coding. There are mainly two major parts in Huffman Coding 1) Build a Huffman Tree from input characters. 2) Traverse the Huffman Tree and assign codes to characters. Steps to build Huffman Tree Input is an array of unique characters along with their frequency of occurrences and output is Huffman Tree. 1. Create a leaf node for each unique character and build a min heap of all leaf nodes (Min Heap is used as a priority queue . The value of frequency field is used to compare two nodes in min heap . Initially, the least frequent character is at root) 2. Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency from the min heap. 3. Create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its left child and the other extracted node as its right child. Add this node to the min heap. 4. Repeat steps #2 and #3 until the heap contains only one node. The remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.

The problem of computing the n*th Fibonacci number *F ( n ), can be broken down into the subproblems of computing F ( n \u2212 1) and F ( n \u2212 2), and then adding the two. The subproblem of computing F ( n \u2212 1) can itself be broken down into a subproblem that involves computing F ( n \u2212 2).

The problem of computing the n*th Fibonacci number *F ( n ), can be broken down into the subproblems of computing F ( n \u2212 1) and F ( n \u2212 2), and then adding the two.

Merge algorithms are a family of algorithms that take multiple sorted lists as input and produce a single list as output, containing all the elements of the inputs lists in sorted order. These algorithms are used as subroutines in various sorting algorithms , most famously merge sort . Application The merge algorithm plays a critical role in the merge sort algorithm, a comparison-based sorting algorithm . Conceptually, merge sort algorithm consists of two steps: 1\u3001 Recursively divide the list into sublists of (roughly) equal length, until each sublist contains only one element, or in the case of iterative (bottom up) merge sort, consider a list of n elements as n sub-lists of size 1. A list containing a single element is, by definition, sorted. NOTE: 1\u3001\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651 \"iterative (bottom up) merge sort\" \u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0 2\u3001Repeatedly merge sublists to create a new sorted sublist until the single list contains all elements. The single list is the sorted list. NOTE: 1\u3001\u8fd9\u5176\u5b9e\u5c31\u975e\u5e38\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e k-way merge The merge algorithm is used repeatedly in the merge sort algorithm . An example merge sort is given in the illustration. It starts with an unsorted array of 7 integers. The array is divided into 7 partitions; each partition contains 1 element and is sorted. The sorted partitions are then merged to produce larger, sorted, partitions, until 1 partition, the sorted array, is left. Merging two lists NOTE: 1\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u4e24\u4e2a\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684 Merging two sorted lists into one can be done in linear time and linear space.

Typically we use all of the elements within the window for the problem (for eg - sum of all elements in the window).

Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.[ 3] -3) Binary, or half interval searches , repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.[ 4] -4) Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys.[ 5] Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function .[ 6] Searches outside a linear search require that the data be sorted in some way.

Binary search functions, for example, have a maximum complexity of O (log n ), or logarithmic time. This means that the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space .

They are also used when the goal is to find a variable assignment that will maximize or minimize a certain function of those variables. Algorithms for these problems include the basic brute-force search (also called \"na\u00efve\" or \"uninformed\" search), and a variety of heuristics that try to exploit partial knowledge about the structure of this space, such as linear relaxation, constraint generation, and constraint propagation .

This category includes a great variety of general metaheuristic methods, such as simulated annealing , tabu search , A-teams, and genetic programming , that combine arbitrary heuristics in specific ways. Tree search algorithms This class also includes various tree search algorithms , that view the elements as vertices of a tree , and traverse that tree in some special order. Examples of the latter include the exhaustive methods such as depth-first search and breadth-first search , as well as various heuristic-based search tree pruning methods such as backtracking and branch and bound . Unlike general metaheuristics, which at best work only in a probabilistic sense, many of these tree-search methods are guaranteed to find the exact or optimal solution, if given enough time.

The goal in these problems is to find the move that provides the best chance of a win, taking into account all possible moves of the opponent(s). Similar problems occur when humans or machines have to make successive decisions whose outcomes are not entirely under one's control, such as in robot guidance or in marketing , financial , or military strategy planning. This kind of problem \u2014 combinatorial search \uff08\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\uff09 \u2014 has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence . Examples of algorithms for this class are the minimax algorithm , alpha\u2013beta pruning , * Informational search [ 7] and the A* algorithm . For sub-structures of a given structure The name \"combinatorial search\"\uff08\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\uff09 is generally used for algorithms that look for a specific sub-structure of a given discrete structure , such as a graph, a string , a finite group , and so on. The term combinatorial optimization is typically used when the goal is to find a sub-structure with a maximum (or minimum) value of some parameter. (Since the sub-structure is usually represented in the computer by a set of integer variables with constraints, these problems can be viewed as special cases of constraint satisfaction or discrete optimization; but they are usually formulated and solved in a more abstract setting where the internal representation is not explicitly mentioned.) NOTE: \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u8d77\u6765 Optimal substructure Graph algorithm An important and extensively studied subclass are the graph algorithms , in particular graph traversal algorithms, for finding specific sub-structures in a given graph \u2014 such as subgraphs , paths , circuits, and so on. Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm , Kruskal's algorithm , the nearest neighbour algorithm , and Prim's algorithm . String search algorithm Another important subclass of this category are the string searching algorithms , that search for patterns within strings. Two famous examples are the Boyer\u2013Moore and Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithms , and several algorithms based on the suffix tree data structure. Search for the maximum of a function In 1953, American statistician Jack Kiefer devised Fibonacci search which can be used to find the maximum of a unimodal\uff08\u5355\u5cf0\uff09 function and has many other applications in computer science. For quantum computers There are also search methods designed for quantum computers , like Grover's algorithm , that are theoretically faster than linear or brute-force search even without the help of data structures or heuristics.

Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.[ 3] -3) Binary, or half interval searches , repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.[ 4] -4) Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys.[ 5] Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function .[ 6] Searches outside a linear search require that the data be sorted in some way.

Binary search functions, for example, have a maximum complexity of O (log n ), or logarithmic time.

External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM ) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory , usually a hard disk drive . Thus, external sorting algorithms are external memory algorithms and thus applicable in the external memory model of computation .

It is also the basis of the so-called logic programming languages such as Icon , Planner and Prolog .

The completion is done incrementally, by a sequence of candidate extension steps. Conceptually, the partial candidates are represented as the nodes of a tree structure , the potential search tree. Each partial candidate is the parent of the candidates that differ from it by a single extension step ; the leaves of the tree are the partial candidates that cannot be extended any further. The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively , from the root down, in depth-first order . At each node c , the algorithm checks whether c can be completed to a valid solution. If it cannot, the whole sub-tree rooted at c is skipped ( pruned \uff08\u526a\u679d\uff09). Otherwise, the algorithm (1) checks whether c itself is a valid solution, and if so reports it to the user; and (2) recursively enumerates all sub-trees of c . The two tests and the children of each node are defined by user-given procedures. Therefore, the actual search tree that is traversed by the algorithm is only a part of the potential tree. The total cost of the algorithm is the number of nodes of the actual tree times the cost of obtaining and processing each node. This fact should be considered when choosing the potential search tree and implementing the pruning test. Pseudocode In order to apply backtracking to a specific class of problems, one must provide the data P for the particular instance of the problem that is to be solved, and six procedural parameters , root , reject , accept , first , next , and output . These procedures should take the instance data P as a parameter and should do the following: root ( P ): return the partial candidate at the root of the search tree. reject ( P , c ): return true only if the partial candidate c is not worth completing. accept ( P , c ): return true if c is a solution of P , and false otherwise. first ( P , c ): generate the first extension of candidate c . next ( P , s ): generate the next alternative extension of a candidate, after the extension s . output ( P , c ): use the solution c of P , as appropriate to the application. The backtracking algorithm reduces the problem to the call bt ( root ( P )), where bt is the following recursive procedure: procedure bt(c) if reject(P,c) then return if accept(P,c) then output(P,c) s \u2190 first(P,c) while s \u2260 NULL do bt(s) s \u2190 next(P,s) Usage considerations The reject procedure should be a boolean-valued function that returns true only if it is certain that no possible extension of c is a valid solution for P . If the procedure cannot reach a definite conclusion, it should return false . An incorrect true result may cause the bt procedure to miss some valid solutions. The procedure may assume that reject ( P , t ) returned false for every ancestor t of c in the search tree. On the other hand, the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm depends on reject returning true for candidates that are as close to the root as possible. If reject always returns false , the algorithm will still find all solutions, but it will be equivalent to a brute-force search. The accept procedure should return true if c is a complete and valid solution for the problem instance P , and false otherwise. It may assume that the partial candidate c and all its ancestors in the tree have passed the *reject*test. The general pseudo-code above does not assume that the valid solutions are always leaves of the potential search tree. In other words, it admits the possibility that a valid solution for P can be further extended to yield other valid solutions. The first and next procedures are used by the backtracking algorithm to enumerate the children of a node c of the tree, that is, the candidates that differ from c by a single extension step. The call first ( P , c ) should yield the first child of c , in some order; and the call next ( P , s ) should return the next sibling of node s , in that order. Both functions should return a distinctive \"NULL\" candidate, if the requested child does not exist. Together, the root , first , and next functions define the set of partial candidates and the potential search tree. They should be chosen so that every solution of P occurs somewhere in the tree, and no partial candidate occurs more than once. Moreover, they should admit an efficient and effective reject predicate. Examples Examples where backtracking can be used to solve puzzles or problems include: Puzzles such as eight queens puzzle , crosswords , verbal arithmetic , Sudoku [ nb 1] , and Peg Solitaire . Combinatorial optimization problems such as parsing and the knapsack problem . Logic programming languages such as Icon , Planner and Prolog , which use backtracking internally to generate answers. The following is an example where backtracking is used for the constraint satisfaction problem : Constraint satisfaction The general constraint satisfaction problem consists in finding a list of integers x = ( x [1], x [2], \u2026, x [ n ]), each in some range {1, 2, \u2026, m }, that satisfies some arbitrary constraint (boolean function) F . For this class of problems, the instance data P would be the integers m and n , and the predicate F . In a typical backtracking solution to this problem, one could define a partial candidate as a list of integers c = ( c [1], c [2], \u2026, c [k]), for any k between 0 and n , that are to be assigned to the first k variables x [1], x [2], \u2026, x [ k ]. The root candidate would then be the empty list (). The first and next procedures would then be function first(P, c) k \u2190 length(c) if k = n then return NULL else return (c[1], c[2], \u2026, c[k], 1) function next(P, s) k \u2190 length(s) if s[k] = m then return NULL else return (s[1], s[2], \u2026, s[k - 1], 1 + s[k]) Here length ( c ) is the number of elements in the list c .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Algorithm/State-space-search/Backtracking/wikipedia-Backtracking/#wikipedia#backtracking","text":"NOTE: 1\u3001\u201cbacktracking\u201d\u5373\u201c\u56de\u6eaf\u201d\u3002 Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems , notably constraint satisfaction problems , that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.[ 1] [ 2] NOTE: \u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u53e5\uff0c\u5c31\u70b9\u660e\u4e86backtrack\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u7cbe\u51c6\u3002 Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a \"partial candidate solution\" and a relatively quick test of whether it can possibly be completed to a valid solution(\u526a\u679d).

For this class of problems, the instance data P would be the integers m and n , and the predicate F . In a typical backtracking solution to this problem, one could define a partial candidate as a list of integers c = ( c [1], c [2], \u2026, c [k]), for any k between 0 and n , that are to be assigned to the first k variables x [1], x [2], \u2026, x [ k ]. The root candidate would then be the empty list (). The first and next procedures would then be function first(P, c) k \u2190 length(c) if k = n then return NULL else return (c[1], c[2], \u2026, c[k], 1) function next(P, s) k \u2190 length(s) if s[k] = m then return NULL else return (s[1], s[2], \u2026, s[k - 1], 1 + s[k]) Here length ( c ) is the number of elements in the list c .","title":"Constraint

problems, as well as mathematical optimization . A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search : the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores branches (\u5206\u652f) of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated bounds (\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u9650) on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm. The algorithm depends on efficient estimation of the lower and upper bounds of regions/branches of the search space. If no bounds are available, the algorithm degenerates to an exhaustive search.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Algorithm/State-space-search/Branch-and-Bound/#branch#and#bound","text":"\"Branch and bound\" \u4e00\u822c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a \"\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u6cd5\"\uff1b \u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u7ae0\u8282\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\"Branch and bound\"\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8ba8\u8bba: \u4e00\u3001 Expert-labuladong\\3.2-BFS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u5217","title":"Branch and bound"},{"location":"Algorithm/State-space-search/Branch-and-Bound/#wikipedia#branch#and#bound","text":"Branch and bound ( BB , B&B , or BnB ) is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems, as well as mathematical optimization .

The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another question is whether possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence. An obvious way to generate permutations of n is to generate values for the Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to n !), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires n operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list , both require (for different reasons) about n*2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With *n likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too much of a problem, but it turns out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better.

The values can be interpreted as dark/light, absent/present, locked/unlocked, valid/invalid, et cetera. The point is that there are only two possible values, so they can be stored in one bit. As with other arrays, the access to a single bit can be managed by applying an index to the array . Assuming its size (or length) to be n bits, the array can be used to specify a subset of the domain (e.g. {0, 1, 2, ..., n \u22121}), where a 1-bit indicates the presence and a 0-bit the absence of a number in the set. This set data structure uses about n / w words of space, where w is the number of bits in each machine word . Whether the least significant bit (of the word) or the most significant bit indicates the smallest-index number is largely irrelevant, but the former tends to be preferred (on little-endian machines). Basic operations Although most machines are not able to address individual bits in memory, nor have instructions to manipulate single bits, each bit in a word can be singled out and manipulated using bitwise operations . In particular: OR can be used to set a bit to one: 11101010 OR 00000100 = 11101110 AND can be used to set a bit to zero: 11101010 AND 11111101 = 11101000 AND together with zero-testing can be used to determine if a bit is set: 11101010 AND 00000001 = 00000000 = 0 11101010 AND 00000010 = 00000010 \u2260 0 XOR can be used to invert or toggle a bit: 11101010 XOR 00000100 = 11101110 11101110 XOR 00000100 = 11101010 NOT can be used to invert all bits. NOT 10110010 = 01001101 To obtain the bit mask needed for these operations, we can use a bit shift operator to shift the number 1 to the left by the appropriate number of places, as well as bitwise negation if necessary. Given two bit arrays of the same size representing sets, we can compute their union , intersection , and set-theoretic difference using n / w simple bit operations each (2*n*/ w for difference), as well as the complement of either: for i from 0 to n/w-1 complement_a[i] := not a[i] union[i] := a[i] or b[i] intersection[i] := a[i] and b[i] difference[i] := a[i] and (not b[i]) NOTE: \u4e0a\u8ff0\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e00\u4e2abyte\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662fbit If we wish to iterate through the bits of a bit array, we can do this efficiently using a doubly nested loop that loops through each word, one at a time. Only n / w memory accesses are required: for i from 0 to n/w-1 index := 0 // if needed word := a[i] for b from 0 to w-1 value := word and 1 \u2260 0 word := word shift right 1 // do something with value index := index + 1 // if needed Both of these code samples exhibit ideal locality of reference , which will subsequently receive large performance boost from a data cache. If a cache line is k words, only about n / wk cache misses will occur. More complex operations As with character strings it is straightforward to define length , substring , lexicographical compare , concatenation , reverse operations. The implementation of some of these operations is sensitive to endianness . Population / Hamming weight If we wish to find the number of 1 bits in a bit array, sometimes called the population count or Hamming weight, there are efficient branch-free algorithms that can compute the number of bits in a word using a series of simple bit operations. We simply run such an algorithm on each word and keep a running total. Counting zeros is similar. See the Hamming weight article for examples of an efficient implementation. Inversion Vertical flipping of a one-bit-per-pixel image, or some FFT algorithms, requires flipping the bits of individual words (so b31 b30 ... b0 becomes b0 ... b30 b31 ). When this operation is not available on the processor, it's still possible to proceed by successive passes, in this example on 32 bits: exchange two 16bit halfwords exchange bytes by pairs (0xddccbbaa -> 0xccddaabb) ... swap bits by pairs swap bits (b31 b30 ... b1 b0 -> b30 b31 ... b0 b1) The last operation can be written ((x&0x55555555)<<1) | (x&0xaaaaaaaa)>>1)). Find first one The find first set or find first one operation identifies the index or position of the 1-bit with the smallest index in an array, and has widespread hardware support (for arrays not larger than a word) and efficient algorithms for its computation. When a priority queue is stored in a bit array, find first one can be used to identify the highest priority element in the queue. To expand a word-size find first one to longer arrays, one can find the first nonzero word and then run find first one on that word. The related operations find first zero , count leading zeros , count leading ones , count trailing zeros , count trailing ones , and log base 2 (see find first set ) can also be extended to a bit array in a straightforward manner. \u5f00\u6e90\u5e93 BitArray","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Array/Bit-array/#bit#array","text":"A bit array (also known as bit map , bit set , bit string , or bit vector ) is an array data structure that compactly stores bits .

This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams . Uses The useful property of a circular buffer is that it does not need to have its elements shuffled around(\u79fb\u52a8) when one is consumed. (If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.) In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO buffer. Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Should a maximum size be adopted for a queue, then a circular buffer is a completely ideal implementation; all queue operations are constant time. However, expanding a circular buffer requires shifting memory, which is comparatively costly. For arbitrarily expanding queues, a linked list approach may be preferred instead. In some situations, overwriting(\u76d6\u5199) circular buffer can be used, e.g. in multimedia. If the buffer is used as the bounded buffer in the producer-consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e.g., an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e.g., the sound card ) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates on the assumption that strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer. Circular buffer mechanics A circular buffer can be implemented using four pointers , or two pointers and two integers: buffer start in memory buffer end in memory, or buffer capacity start of valid data (index or pointer) end of valid data (index or pointer), or amount of data currently in the buffer (integer) In utilizing full buffer capacity with pointer-based implementation strategy, the buffer's full or empty state could not be resolved directly from checking the positions of the start and end indexes.[ 1] Therefore, an additional mechanism must be implemented for checking this. One common way to deal with this, when using 2 pointers, is to only allow the buffer to hold (size \u2212 1) items. When both pointers are equal, the buffer is empty, and when the end pointer is one less than the start pointer, the buffer is full.

(If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.) In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO buffer. Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Should a maximum size be adopted for a queue, then a circular buffer is a completely ideal implementation; all queue operations are constant time. However, expanding a circular buffer requires shifting memory, which is comparatively costly. For arbitrarily expanding queues, a linked list approach may be preferred instead. In some situations, overwriting(\u76d6\u5199) circular buffer can be used, e.g. in multimedia. If the buffer is used as the bounded buffer in the producer-consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e.g., an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e.g., the sound card ) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates on the assumption that strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer.","title":"Uses"},{"location":"Data-structure/Array/Circular-array/#circular#buffer#mechanics","text":"A circular buffer can be implemented using four pointers , or two pointers and two integers: buffer start in memory buffer end in memory, or buffer capacity start of valid data (index or pointer) end of valid data (index or pointer), or amount of data currently in the buffer (integer) In utilizing full buffer capacity with pointer-based implementation strategy, the buffer's full or empty state could not be resolved directly from checking the positions of the start and end indexes.[ 1] Therefore, an additional mechanism must be implemented for checking this. One common way to deal with this, when using 2 pointers, is to only allow the buffer to hold (size \u2212 1) items. When both pointers are equal, the buffer is empty, and when the end pointer is one less than the start pointer, the buffer is full.

We will briefly describe two of these models here. Dependency Graph Module Dependency Graphs One of the most important tasks in designing software is how to structure a program into different parts,or modules. Understanding how the different modules of a program interact is essential not only for program design, but also for testing and maintenance of the resulting software. A module dependency graph provides a useful tool for understanding how different modules of a program interact. In a program dependency graph, each module is represented by a vertex. There is a directed edge from a module to a second module if the second module depends on the first. An example of a program dependency graph for a web browser is shown in Figure 9.

It is important not to execute a statement that requires results of statements not yet executed. The dependence of statements on previous statements can be represented by a directed graph. Each statement is represented by a vertex, and there is an edge from one statement to a second statement if the second statement cannot be executed before the first statement. This resulting graph is called a precedence graph . A computer program and its graph are displayed in Figure 10. For instance, the graph shows that statement S5 cannot be executed before statements S1 , S2 , and S4 are executed.

Round-Robin Tournaments A tournament where each team plays every other team exactly once and no ties are allowed is called a round-robin tournament . Such tournaments can be modeled using directed graphs where each team is represented by a vertex. Note that (a,b) is an edge if team a beats team b . This graph is a simple directed graph, containing no loops or multiple directed edges (because no two teams play each other more than once). Such a directed graph model is presented in Figure 13. We see that Team 1 is undefeated in this tournament, and Team 3 is winless. Single-Elimination Tournaments A tournament where each contestant is eliminated after one loss is called a single-elimination tournament. Single-elimination tournaments are often used in sports, including tennis championships and the yearly NCAA basketball championship. We can model such a tournament using a vertex to represent each game and a directed edge to connect a game to the next game the winner of this game played in. The graph in Figure 14 represents the games played by the final 16 teams in the 2010 NCAA women\u2019s basketball tournament.

DEFINITION Two vertices u and v in an undirected graph G are called adjacent (or neighbors ) in G if u and v are endpoints of an edge e of G . Such an edge e is called incident with the vertices u and v and e is said to connect u and v . DEFINITION The set of all neighbors of a vertex v of G = (V,E) , denoted by N(v) , is called the neighborhood of v . If A is a subset of V , we denote by N(A) the set of all vertices in G that are adjacent to at least one vertex in A . So, N(A) =U v\u2208A N(v) .

The degree of the vertex v is denoted by deg(v) . THE HANDSHAKING THEOREM Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph with m edges. Then $$ 2m = \\sum_{v \\in V} deg(v) $$ (Note that this applies even if multiple edges and loops are present.) THEOREM An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.

DEFINITION When (u,v) is an edge of the graph G with directed edges, u is said to be adjacent to v and v is said to be adjacent from u . The vertex u is called the initial vertex of (u,v) , and v is called the terminal or end vertex of (u,v) . The initial vertex and terminal vertex of a loop are the same. DEFINITION In a graph with directed edges the in-degree of a vertex v , denoted by deg \u2212 (v) , is the number of edges with v as their terminal vertex. The out-degree of v , denoted by deg + (v) , is the number of edges with v as their initial vertex. (Note that a loop at a vertex contributes 1 to both the in-degree and the out-degree of this vertex.) THEOREM Let G = (V,E) be a graph with directed edges. Then $$ \\sum_{v \\in V} deg^-(v) = \\sum_{v \\in V} deg^+(v)=|E| $$ There are many properties of a graph with directed edges that do not depend on the direction of its edges.Consequently, it is often useful to ignore these directions. The undirected graph that results from ignoring directions of edges is called the underlying undirected graph . A graph with directed edges and its underlying undirected graph have the same number of edges.

The graphs K_n K_n , for n = 1,2,3,4,5,6, are displayed in Figure 3. A simple graph for which there is at least one pair of distinct vertex not connected by an edge is called noncomplete . Cycles A cycle C_n C_n , n \u2265 3, consists of n vertices v_1 ,v_2 ,...,v_n v_1 ,v_2 ,...,v_n and edges \\{v_1 ,v_2 \\} \\{v_1 ,v_2 \\} , \\{v_2 ,v_3 \\} \\{v_2 ,v_3 \\} ,..., \\{v_{n\u22121} ,v_n \\} \\{v_{n\u22121} ,v_n \\} , and {v_n ,v_1 } {v_n ,v_1 } . The cycles C_3 C_3 , C_4 C_4 , C_5 C_5 , and C_6 C_6 are displayed in Figure 4. Wheels We obtain a wheel W_n W_n when we add an additional vertex to a cycle C_n C_n , for n \u2265 3, and connect this new vertex to each of the n vertices in C_n C_n , by new edges. The wheels W_3 W_3 , W_4 W_4 , W_5 W_5 , and W_6 W_6 are displayed in Figure 5. n-Cubes An n-dimensional hypercube,or n-cube,denoted by Q_n Q_n ,is a graph that has vertices representing the 2^n 2^n bit strings of length n . Two vertices are adjacent if and only if the bit strings that they represent differ in exactly one bit position. We display Q_1 Q_1 ,$ Q_2$ , and Q_3 Q_3 in Figure 6. Note that you can construct the (n + 1)-cube Q_{n+1} Q_{n+1} from the n-cube Q_n Q_n by making two copies of Q_n Q_n , prefacing the labels on the vertices with a 0 in one copy of Q_n Q_n and with a 1 in the other copy of Q_n Q_n , and adding edges connecting two vertices that have labels differing only in the first bit. In Figure 6, Q_ 3 Q_ 3 is constructed from Q_2 Q_2 by drawing two copies of Q_2 Q_2 as the top and bottom faces of Q_3 Q_3 , adding 0 at the beginning of the label of each vertex in the bottom face and 1 at the beginning of the label of each vertex in the top face. (Here, by face we mean a face of a cube in three-dimensional space. Think of drawing the graph Q_3 Q_3 in three-dimensional space with copies of Q_2 Q_2 as the top and bottom faces of a cube and then drawing the projection of the resulting depiction in the plane.) NOTE: How about Q_4 Q_4 ? see the wikipedia entry Hypercube . Bipartite Graphs Sometimes a graph has the property that its vertex set can be divided into two disjoint subsets such that each edge connects a vertex in one of these subsets to a vertex in the other subset. For example, consider the graph representing marriages between men and women in a village, where each person is represented by a vertex and a marriage is represented by an edge. In this graph, each edge connects a vertex in the subset of vertices representing males and a vertex in the subset of vertices representing females. This leads us to Definition 5. DEFINITION A simple graph G is called bipartite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into two disjoint sets V_1 V_1 and V_2 V_2 such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex in V_1 V_1 and a vertex in V_2 V_2 (so that no edge in G connects either two vertices in V_1 V_1 or two vertices in V_2 V_2 ). When this condition holds, we call the pair (V_1 ,V_2 ) (V_1 ,V_2 ) a bipartition of the vertex set V of G. In Example 9 we will show that C_6 C_6 is bipartite, and in Example 10 we will show that K_3 K_3 is not bipartite. Theorem below provides a useful criterion for determining whether a graph is bipartite. THEOREM 4 A simple graph is bipartite if and only if it is possible to assign one of two different colors to each vertex of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color. Theorem 4 is an example of a result in the part of graph theory known as graph colorings . Graph colorings is an important part of graph theory with important applications. We will study graph colorings further in Section 10.8. Another useful criterion for determining whether a graph is bipartite is based on the notion of a path , a topic we study in Section 10.4. A graph is bipartite if and only if it is not possible to start at a vertex and return to this vertex by traversing an odd number of distinct edges. We will make this notion more precise when we discuss paths and circuits in graphs in Section 10.4 (see Exercise 63 in that section).

In directed graphs , the connections between nodes have a direction, and are called arcs ; in undirected graphs , the connections have no direction and are called edges . We mainly discuss directed graphs . Algorithms in graphs include finding a path between two nodes, finding the shortest path between two nodes, determining cycles in the graph (a cycle is a non-empty path from a node to itself), finding a path that reaches all nodes (the famous \"traveling salesman problem\"), and so on. Sometimes the nodes or arcs of a graph have weights or costs associated with them, and we are interested in finding the cheapest path . There's considerable literature on graph algorithms, which are an important part of discrete mathematics. Graphs also have much practical use in computer algorithms. Obvious examples can be found in the management of networks, but examples abound in many other areas. For instance, caller-callee relationships in a computer program can be seen as a graph (where cycles indicate recursion, and unreachable nodes represent dead code). Few programming languages provide direct support for graphs as a data type, and Python is no exception. However, graphs are easily built out of lists and dictionaries . For instance, here's a simple graph (I can't use drawings in these columns, so I write down the graph's arcs): A -> B A -> C B -> C B -> D C -> D D -> C E -> F F -> C This graph has six nodes (A-F) and eight arcs. It can be represented by the following Python data structure: graph = { 'A' : [ 'B' , 'C' ], 'B' : [ 'C' , 'D' ], 'C' : [ 'D' ], 'D' : [ 'C' ], 'E' : [ 'F' ], 'F' : [ 'C' ]} This is a dictionary whose keys are the nodes of the graph. For each key, the corresponding value is a list containing the nodes that are connected by a direct arc from this node. This is about as simple as it gets (even simpler, the nodes could be represented by numbers instead of names, but names are more convenient and can easily be made to carry more information, such as city names). Let's write a simple function to determine a path between two nodes. It takes a graph and the start and end nodes as arguments. It will return a list of nodes (including the start and end nodes) comprising the path. When no path can be found, it returns None. The same node will not occur more than once on the path returned (i.e. it won't contain cycles). The algorithm uses an important technique called backtracking : it tries each possibility in turn until it finds a solution. def find_path ( graph , start , end , path = []): path = path + [ start ] if start == end : return path if start not in graph : # \u539f\u6587\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\u662f\uff1aif not graph.has_key(start)\uff0cpython 3\u4e2ddict\u6ca1\u6709has_key\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570 return None for node in graph [ start ]: # adjacent nodes if node not in path : newpath = find_path ( graph , node , end , path ) if newpath : return newpath return None A sample run (using the graph above): >>> find_path ( graph , 'A' , 'D' ) [ 'A' , 'B' , 'C' , 'D' ] >>> The second ' if ' statement is necessary only in case there are nodes that are listed as end points for arcs but that don't have outgoing arcs themselves, and aren't listed in the graph at all. Such nodes could also be contained in the graph, with an empty list of outgoing arcs, but sometimes it is more convenient not to require this. NOTE: \u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u6ca1\u6709\u8bfb\u61c2 Note that while the user calls find_path() with three arguments, it calls itself with a fourth argument: the path that has already been traversed. The default value for this argument is the empty list, ' [] ', meaning no nodes have been traversed yet. This argument is used to avoid cycles (the first ' if ' inside the ' for ' loop). The ' path ' argument is not modified: the assignment \" path = path + [start] \" creates a new list. If we had written \" path.append(start) \" instead, we would have modified the variable ' path ' in the caller, with disastrous results. (Using tuples, we could have been sure this would not happen, at the cost of having to write \" path = path + (start,) \" since \" (start) \" isn't a singleton tuple -- it is just a parenthesized expression.) It is simple to change this function to return a list of all paths (without cycles) instead of the first path it finds: def find_all_paths ( graph , start , end , path = []): path = path + [ start ] if start == end : return [ path ] if start not in graph : # \u539f\u6587\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\u662f\uff1aif not graph.has_key(start)\uff0cpython 3\u4e2ddict\u6ca1\u6709has_key\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570 return [] paths = [] for node in graph [ start ]: if node not in path : newpaths = find_all_paths ( graph , node , end , path ) for newpath in newpaths : paths . append ( newpath ) return paths A sample run: >>> find_all_paths ( graph , 'A' , 'D' ) [[ 'A' , 'B' , 'C' , 'D' ], [ 'A' , 'B' , 'D' ], [ 'A' , 'C' , 'D' ]] >>> Another variant finds the shortest path: def find_shortest_path ( graph , start , end , path = []): path = path + [ start ] if start == end : return path if start not in graph : # \u539f\u6587\u7684\u5199\u6cd5\u662f\uff1aif not graph.has_key(start)\uff0cpython 3\u4e2ddict\u6ca1\u6709has_key\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570 return None shortest = None for node in graph [ start ]: if node not in path : newpath = find_shortest_path ( graph , node , end , path ) if newpath : if not shortest or len ( newpath ) < len ( shortest ): shortest = newpath return shortest Sample run: >>> find_shortest_path ( graph , 'A' , 'D' ) [ 'A' , 'C' , 'D' ] >>> These functions are about as simple as they get.

This, too, will be the subject of another column.","title":"python Python Patterns - Implementing Graphs"},{"location":"Data-structure/Graph/Graph-theory/Graph-representations/Incidence-matrix/","text":"Incidence matrix \u662f\u5728\u5b66\u4e60boost IncidenceGraph \u65f6\uff0c\u60f3\u5230\u7684incidence matrix\u3002 \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 Incidence matrix","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Graph/Graph-theory/Graph-representations/Incidence-matrix/#incidence#matrix","text":"\u662f\u5728\u5b66\u4e60boost IncidenceGraph \u65f6\uff0c\u60f3\u5230\u7684incidence matrix\u3002","title":"Incidence matrix"},{"location":"Data-structure/Graph/Graph-theory/Graph-representations/Incidence-matrix/#incidence#matrix_1","text":"","title":"\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1Incidence matrix"},{"location":"Data-structure/Graph/Graph-traversal/","text":"Graph traversal \u8fd9\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u79cdgraph\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002 wikipedia Graph traversal In computer science , graph traversal (also known as graph search ) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph . Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal. NOTE: 1\u3001\u5176\u5b9etraversal\u5c31\u662fsearch Redundancy Unlike tree traversal, graph traversal may require that some vertices be visited more than once, since it is not necessarily known before transitioning to a vertex that it has already been explored. As graphs become more dense , this redundancy becomes more prevalent(\u666e\u904d), causing computation time to increase; as graphs become more sparse, the opposite holds true. NOTE: 1\u3001dense and sparse Thus, it is usually necessary to remember which vertices have already been explored by the algorithm, so that vertices are revisited as infrequently as possible (or in the worst case, to prevent the traversal from continuing indefinitely(\u5176\u5b9e\u5c31\u662f**dead loop**)). This may be accomplished by associating each vertex of the graph with a \"color\" or \"visitation\" state during the traversal, which is then checked and updated as the algorithm visits each vertex. If the vertex has already been visited, it is ignored and the path is pursued(\u8ffd\u8e2a) no further; otherwise, the algorithm checks/updates the vertex and continues down its current path.

An important example of this is a tree: during a traversal it may be assumed that all \"ancestor\" vertices of the current vertex (and others depending on the algorithm) have already been visited. Both the depth-first and breadth-first graph searches are adaptations of tree-based algorithms, distinguished primarily by the lack of a structurally determined \"root\" vertex and the addition of a data structure to record the traversal's visitation state.

The recursive implementation will visit the nodes from the example graph in the following order: A, B, D, F, E, C, G. The non-recursive implementation will visit the nodes as: A, E, F, B, D, C, G. The non-recursive implementation is similar to breadth-first search but differs from it in two ways: 1\u3001it uses a stack instead of a queue, and 2\u3001it delays checking whether a vertex has been discovered until the vertex is popped from the stack rather than making this check before adding the vertex. NOTE: 1\u3001\u5982\u679c\"making this check before adding the vertex\"\u4f1a\u600e\u6837\uff1f If G is a tree , replacing the queue of the breadth-first search algorithm with a stack will yield a depth-first search algorithm. For general graphs, replacing the stack of the iterative depth-first search implementation with a queue would also produce a breadth-first search algorithm, although a somewhat nonstandard one.[ 7] Another possible implementation of iterative depth-first search Another possible implementation of iterative depth-first search uses a stack of iterators of the list of neighbors of a node, instead of a stack of nodes. This yields the same traversal as recursive DFS.[ 8] procedure DFS_iterative(G, v) is let S be a stack S.push(iterator of G.adjacentEdges(v)) while S is not empty do if S.peek().hasNext() then w = S.peek().next() if w is not labeled as discovered then label w as discovered S.push(iterator of G.adjacentEdges(w)) else S.pop() NOTE: 1\u3001\u4e0a\u8ff0code\u5982\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\uff1f Applications Algorithms that use depth-first search as a building block include: Connected components 1\u3001Finding connected components .

Pearl, \"Heuristics\", Addison-Wesley, 1984. Important issues about Search Algorithms We will address: 1. how to write search algorithms. In particular we will examine: the data structure to keep unexplored nodes. We use a queue (often called a list in many AI books) called OPEN . expansion of a node (or generation of its successors). All the successors of a node can be generated at once (method most commonly used) or they could be generated one at a time either in a systematic way or in a random way. The number of successors is called the branching factor . strategies for selecting which node to expand next. Different algorithms result from different choices (e.g. depth-first when successor nodes are added at the beginning of the queue, breadth-first when successor nodes are added at the end of the queue, etc), test for goal. We will assume the existence of a predicate that applied to a state will return true or false. bookkeeping (keeping track of visited nodes, keeping track of path to goal, etc). Keeping track of visited nodes is usually done by keeping them in a queue (or, better a hash-table) called CLOSED . This prevents getting trapped into loops or repeating work but results in a large space complexity.

The major difference is in the specification of how to handle nodes already seen (Russell and Norvig do not specify what to do) and in when goal test is done (Russell and Norvig in Graph-Search check for goal only on the first element of OPEN , Pearl checks as soon as the successors of a node are generated).

We assume arc costs to be positive. The start node has a cost g(s) = 0 . h(n) is an underestimate of the cost of the optimal path from n to goal. If we call h*(n) the cost of the optimal path forall n h(n) < = h*(n) . This implies that a goal node has a cost h(goal) = 0 The check for the goal node (step 2.2) must be done after the node has been selected for expansion to guarantee an optimal solution NOTE: \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1f The redirection of the parent pointer is done using only the g value of the node (not the f value). This guarantees that the path used to any node is the best path. When the heuristic used is monotone\uff08\u5355\u8c03\u7684\uff09, A* never reopens nodes from CLOSED . This means that whenever a node is put into CLOSED , A* has already found the optimal path to it. If forall n h(n) = 0 the algorithm A* is the same as Branch&Bound (or Uniform Cost). If forall n h(n) = 0 and forall n, n' c(n,n')=1 the algorithm A* is the same as Breadth-First Search. Properties of A* Completeness: guaranteed even on infinite graphs provided that the branching factor is finite and that there is some positive constant delta such that every operator cost at least delta. Admissibility: guaranteed given an admissible heuristics (i.e. h(n) is an underestimate of the cost of the optimal path from n to the goal for every node) Time Complexity: depends on the accuracy of the heuristic function. If the heuristic function is exact A* runs in linear time, if the heuristic function is useless, the time complexity is exponential (as for uniform cost). Space Complexity: O(B to the power of d) Iterative-Deepening A* ( IDA* ) IDA* is similar to Depth-First Iterative-Deepening, the difference being the cutoff criteria. A path is cutoff when its total cots f(n) exceeds a cost threshold. IDA* starts with a threshold equal to f(s) (which is equal to h'(s) since g(s) = 0). Each iteration is a depth-first search, cutting off a branch when its f(n) value exceeds the threshold. If a solution is found, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, the threshold is increased to the minimum f value that exceeded the previous threshold and another depth-first search is started from scratch. This continues until a solution is found. Time Complexity: depends on the accuracy of the heuristic function. If the heuristic function is exact IDA* runs in linear time, if the heuristic function is useless, the time complexity is exponential (as for uniform cost).

If the architecture has a hardware multiply functional unit, the multiply-by-inverse is likely a better approach.","title":"draft"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Application-of-hash/","text":"liblex Symbol table \u5728python\u4e2d\u6709hashable\u7684\u6982\u5ff5 TODO https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/permutations-ii/solution/hui-su-suan-fa-python-dai-ma-java-dai-ma-by-liwe-2/ hash\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u91cd https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3435616/c-string-compare-vs-hash-compare https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10534937/comparing-long-strings-by-their-hashes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/51933/string-comparison-vs-hashing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm Hashing - The Greatest Idea In Programming https://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/479-hashing.html https://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/479-hashing.html?start=1 Applications of Hashing https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-hashing/ python\u4e2d\u7684symbol table\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684hash \u5417\uff1f","title":"Application of hash"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Application-of-hash/#todo","text":"https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/permutations-ii/solution/hui-su-suan-fa-python-dai-ma-java-dai-ma-by-liwe-2/ hash\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u91cd https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3435616/c-string-compare-vs-hash-compare https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10534937/comparing-long-strings-by-their-hashes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/51933/string-comparison-vs-hashing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm","title":"TODO"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Application-of-hash/#hashing#-#the#greatest#idea#in#programming","text":"https://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/479-hashing.html https://www.i-programmer.info/babbages-bag/479-hashing.html?start=1","title":"Hashing - The Greatest Idea In Programming"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Application-of-hash/#applications#of#hashing","text":"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-hashing/","title":"Applications of Hashing"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Application-of-hash/#pythonsymbol#tablehash","text":"","title":"python\u4e2d\u7684symbol table\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684hash \u5417\uff1f"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/TODO-geeksforgeeks-Top-20-Hashing-Technique-based-Interview-Questions/","text":"","title":"TODO geeksforgeeks Top 20 Hashing Technique based Interview Questions"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Checksum/","text":"Checksum wikipedia Checksum A checksum is a small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage .

To check if two files are duplicates of each other, we should do a one-to-one check for the suspect files. Even though this is simple for smaller files, performing a one-to-one (byte-to-byte) comparison for large files is a massively time-consuming task. Imagine comparing two gigantic files to check whether they are duplicates, the time and the effort you need to spare for undertaking such a task is probably enough to simply make you give up. An easy way to remove duplicates would be to utilize an all-purpose duplicate cleaner such as the Clone Files Checker . It works on the basis of highly advanced algorithms and saves your time in organizing files. Let\u2019s imagine that we are downloading a large file over the Internet and we need to make sure that the file was not modified by a third-party in the midst of the transmission, which may cause a man-in-the-middle attack. Checking each byte over the Internet would take years to accomplish and also eat up a significant portion of your Internet bandwidth. So, how can we easily compare two files in such manner that is credible yet not at all laborious? There are multiple ways to do so, including Hash Comparison which is turning out to be a highly popular and reliable. NOTE: 1\u3001\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u57fa\u4e8ehash comparison What is a hash? Hash is a mathematical function which takes objects as inputs and produces as output a number or a string. These input objects can vary from numbers and strings (text) to large byte streams (files or network data). The output is usually known as the hash of the input. The main properties of a hash function are: 1\u3001Easy to compute 2\u3001Relatively small output Example We can define a hash function to get the hash of the numbers between 0 to 9999. h(x) = x mod 100 In the above-mentioned hash function, you can see that there is a significant probability of getting the same hash (collision) for two different inputs. (i.e. 1 and 1001). So, it is always good to have a better hash function with fewer collisions, which makes it difficult to find two inputs which give the same output. While hashing is used in many applications such as hash-tables (data structure), compression and encryption, it is also used to generate checksums of files, network data and many other input types. Checksum The checksum is a small sized datum, generated by applying a hash function on a large chunk of data. This hash function should have a minimum rate of collisions such that the hashes for different inputs are almost unique. That means, getting the same hash for different inputs is nearly impossible in practice. These checksums are used to verify if a segment of data has been modified. The checksum (from a known hash function) of received data can be compared with the checksum provided by the sender to verify the purity of the segment. That is how all the data is verified in TCP/IP protocols. NOTE: 1\u3001\u6240\u8c13\"purity\"\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u662fdata integrity In this way, if we generate two checksums for two files, we can declare that the two files aren\u2019t duplicates if the checksums are different. If the checksums are equal, we can claim that the files are identical, considering the fact that getting the same hash for two different files is almost impossible. NOTE: 1\u3001\u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u89c2\u70b9 And many websites provide hashes of the files at the download pages, especially when the files are located on different servers. In such a scenario, the user can verify the authenticity of a file by comparing the provided hash with the one he generated using the downloaded file. There are various hashing functions that are used to generate checksums. Here are some popular ones. Name Output size MD5 128bits SHA-1 160bits SHA-256 256bits SHA-512 512bits MD5 MD5 is a popular hashing function which was initially used for cryptographic purposes. Even though this generates 128-bit output, many people no longer use it due to a host of vulnerabilities that later surfaced. However, it still can be used as a checksum to verify the authenticity of a file (or a data segment) to detect unintentional changes/corruptions. SHA-1 SHA 1 ( Secure Hash Algorithm 1 ) is a cryptographic hashing function which generates a 160-bit output.

This happens due to many factors, and the creation of duplicate files is one of them. Duplicate files decrease the performance of a system drastically. They aren\u2019t created by the user intentionally, but nevertheless, they will clutter the hard drive and cause disorganization of data without the user even knowing about them. Luckily enough, some genius people have worked endlessly to come up with unique state-of-the-art methods that make scanning for and getting rid of duplicate data of all kinds a very straightforward matter. So let\u2019s jump into some detail of the mechanism that is employed to scan for duplicates and then we shall move on to a genius solution of its own kind. But let\u2019s just introduce it to you before we go into more details. Clone Files Checker is its name, and its job is to go after those pesky duplicates on Windows as well as Mac systems! Why Use MD5 Check to find Duplicate Files? The history of MD5 starts from 1991 when the systems had already been upgraded to 128-bit data transfer rates and a security feature that could encrypt 128-bit data slot was very much needed. MD5 was initially used for cryptographic purposes only, but the discovery of several vulnerabilities meant it was put out of service soon after. However, the algorithm is still used to verify the authenticity of a file, and to know if it has been through an event of data corruption. The benefits of MD5 check over other cryptic algorithms is that it can be implemented faster than the other cryptic algorithms and provides an impressive performance increase for verifying data in comparison with SHA1 , SHA2 and SHA3 cryptic software. However, MD5 is vulnerable to collision resistance. But, the good point is that in finding duplicate files, collision resistance is not really an issue. Collision resistance refers to two inputs providing the same outputs when hashed. But A good MD5 hash program will work in unison with the file size, type, and the last byte value. This is because it is common for various parameters of some files to be similar/ identical/ different (size, name etc) but the hash value will always be the same (provided these files are duplicates). This absolutely does away with the chances of deleting a file which isn\u2019t a duplicate while cleaning up duplicate data. Therefore, MD5 is a huge blessing while on the lookout for duplicates. Now let\u2019s take a brief look at a software that uses MD5 to weed out duplicates swiftly and accurately. Clone Files Checker This software is simply put, a death sentence for duplicate data. Be it duplicate data of any kind, located on your local computer, external hard drive or even your cloud account, this software will dive into great details and make exceptional use of MD5 Check to bring up a list of all the duplicate data that had eaten into your previous hard drive and was beginning to slow down your system. From then onwards, it is pretty simple for you to choose between deleting the duplicates permanently or moving them to a separate folder. But it is all due to the goodness offered by MD5 Check and the genius brains behind Clone Files Checker that you can be assured to a swift and accurate scan that will help free up a big quantum of your hard drive.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Hash-application/%E5%8E%BB%E9%87%8D/Use-checksum-to-find-duplicate-file/#use#checksum#to#find#duplicate#file","text":"\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u57fa\u4e8ehash comparison","title":"Use checksum to find duplicate file"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Hash-application/%E5%8E%BB%E9%87%8D/Use-checksum-to-find-duplicate-file/#clonefileschecker#hashing#algorithms#to#find#duplicates","text":"NOTE: 1\u3001\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5176\u5b9e\u5c31\u662f\u57fa\u4e8echecksum\u6765\u8fdb\u884c(hash) comparison\uff0c\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u591a\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4e4b\u5904 Finding duplicate files is a hectic task when you have millions of files spread all over your computer. To check if two files are duplicates of each other, we should do a one-to-one check for the suspect files. Even though this is simple for smaller files, performing a one-to-one (byte-to-byte) comparison for large files is a massively time-consuming task. Imagine comparing two gigantic files to check whether they are duplicates, the time and the effort you need to spare for undertaking such a task is probably enough to simply make you give up. An easy way to remove duplicates would be to utilize an all-purpose duplicate cleaner such as the Clone Files Checker . It works on the basis of highly advanced algorithms and saves your time in organizing files. Let\u2019s imagine that we are downloading a large file over the Internet and we need to make sure that the file was not modified by a third-party in the midst of the transmission, which may cause a man-in-the-middle attack. Checking each byte over the Internet would take years to accomplish and also eat up a significant portion of your Internet bandwidth. So, how can we easily compare two files in such manner that is credible yet not at all laborious? There are multiple ways to do so, including Hash Comparison which is turning out to be a highly popular and reliable.

The values returned by a hash function are called hash values , hash codes , digests , or simply hashes . NOTE: \"digests\" means \u6458\u8981 in Chinese. Overview NOTE: Although this article is named Hash function , what this chapter talks about is hash table. A hash function takes as input a key, which is associated with a datum or record and used to identify it to the data storage and retrieval application. The keys may be fixed length , like an integer, or variable length , like a name. In some cases, the key is the datum itself. The output is a hash code used to index a hash table holding the data or records, or pointers to them. A hash function may be considered to perform three functions: Convert variable length keys into fixed length (usually machine word length or less) values, by folding them by words or other units using a parity-preserving operator like ADD or XOR. NOTE: Folding means bitwise operation. NOTE: What is parity-preserving operator? Parity bit Scramble the bits of the key so that the resulting values are uniformly distributed over the key space . NOTE: What is the key space? ASCII code? Map the key values into ones less than or equal to the size of the table NOTE: This function will be used only when it is used as index of the table in hash table . In other applications, this function may be omitted. A good hash function satisfies two basic properties: 1) it should be very fast to compute; NOTE: This is efficiency 2) it should minimize duplication of output values (collisions). NOTE: This is uniformity Hash functions rely on generating favorable probability distributions for their effectiveness, reducing access time to nearly constant. High table loading factors, pathological key sets and poorly designed hash functions can result in access times approaching linear in the number of items in the table. Hash functions can be designed to give best worst-case performance, good performance under high table loading factors, and in special cases, perfect (collisionless) mapping of keys into hash codes. Implementation is based on parity-preserving bit operations (XOR and ADD), multiply, or divide. A necessary adjunct to the hash function is a collision-resolution method that employs an auxiliary data structure like linked lists , or systematic probing of the table to find an empty slot. Properties Note: Properties determine their usage, it is necessary to know the properties a hash function possess. Uniformity Note: \u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 Hash table#Choosing a hash function \u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff1a A basic requirement is that the function should provide a uniform distribution of hash values. A good hash function should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range. That is, every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same probability . The reason for this last requirement is that the cost of hashing-based methods goes up sharply as the number of collisions \u2014pairs of inputs that are mapped to the same hash value \u2014increases. If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries. Note that this criterion only requires the value to be uniformly distributed , not random in any sense. A good randomizing function is (barring computational efficiency concerns) generally a good choice as a hash function , but the converse need not be true. NOTE: hash function VS randomizing function Hash tables often contain only a small subset of the valid inputs. For instance, a club membership list may contain only a hundred or so member names, out of the very large set of all possible names. In these cases, the uniformity criterion should hold for almost all typical subsets of entries that may be found in the table, not just for the global set of all possible entries. NOTE: Typical subset VS global set Efficiency In most applications, it is highly desirable that the hash function be computable with minimum latency and secondarily in a minimum number of instructions. Universality Universal hashing Applicability A hash function should be applicable to all situations in which a hash function might be used. A hash function that allows only certain table sizes, strings only up to a certain length, or can't accept a seed (i.e. allow double hashing) isn't as useful as one that does. NOTE: The seed in the paragraph is salt (cryptography) . Reference the Deterministic to see the value of the seed. Deterministic A hash procedure must be deterministic \u2014meaning that for a given input value it must always generate the same hash value. In other words, it must be a function of the data to be hashed, in the mathematical sense of the term. This requirement excludes hash functions that depend on external variable parameters, such as pseudo-random number generators or the time of day. It also excludes functions that depend on the memory address of the object being hashed in cases that the address may change during execution (as may happen on systems that use certain methods of garbage collection ), although sometimes rehashing of the item is possible. The determinism is in the context of the reuse of the function. For example, Python adds the feature that hash functions make use of a randomized seed that is generated once when the Python process starts in addition to the input to be hashed. The Python hash is still a valid hash function when used within a single run. But if the values are persisted (for example, written to disk) they can no longer be treated as valid hash values, since in the next run the random value might differ. Note: Reference python doc: object.__hash__ ( self ) \u00b6 Defined range Fixed-length hash It is often desirable that the output of a hash function have fixed size (but see below). If, for example, the output is constrained to 32-bit integer values, the hash values can be used to index into an array. Such hashing is commonly used to accelerate data searches. Producing fixed-length output from variable length input can be accomplished by breaking the input data into chunks of specific size. Hash functions used for data searches use some arithmetic expression which iteratively processes chunks of the input (such as the characters in a string) to produce the hash value. Variable range In many applications, the range of hash values may be different for each run of the program, or may change along the same run (for instance, when a hash table needs to be expanded). In those situations, one needs a hash function which takes two parameters\u2014the input data z , and the number n of allowed hash values. NOTE: n \u662f codomain \u7684 cardinality A common solution is to compute a fixed hash function with a very large range (say, 0 to 2^{32} \u2212 1 2^{32} \u2212 1 ), divide the result by n , and use the division's remainder . If n is itself a power of 2, this can be done by bit masking and bit shifting . When this approach is used, the hash function must be chosen so that the result has fairly uniform distribution between 0 and n \u2212 1, for any value of n that may occur in the application. Depending on the function, the remainder may be uniform only for certain values of n , e.g. odd or prime numbers . Variable range with minimal movement (dynamic hash function) When the hash function is used to store values in a hash table that outlives the run of the program, and the hash table needs to be expanded or shrunk, the hash table is referred to as a dynamic hash table . A hash function that will relocate the minimum number of records when the table is resized is desirable. What is needed is a hash function H ( z , n ) \u2013 where z is the key being hashed and n is the number of allowed hash values \u2013 such that H ( z , n + 1) = H ( z , n ) with probability close to n /( n + 1). Linear hashing and spiral storage are examples of dynamic hash functions that execute in constant time but relax the property of uniformity to achieve the minimal movement property. Extendible hashing uses a dynamic hash function that requires space proportional to n to compute the hash function, and it becomes a function of the previous keys that have been inserted.

A hash function takes as input a key, which is associated with a datum or record and used to identify it to the data storage and retrieval application. The keys may be fixed length , like an integer, or variable length , like a name. In some cases, the key is the datum itself. The output is a hash code used to index a hash table holding the data or records, or pointers to them. A hash function may be considered to perform three functions: Convert variable length keys into fixed length (usually machine word length or less) values, by folding them by words or other units using a parity-preserving operator like ADD or XOR. NOTE: Folding means bitwise operation. NOTE: What is parity-preserving operator? Parity bit Scramble the bits of the key so that the resulting values are uniformly distributed over the key space . NOTE: What is the key space? ASCII code? Map the key values into ones less than or equal to the size of the table NOTE: This function will be used only when it is used as index of the table in hash table . In other applications, this function may be omitted. A good hash function satisfies two basic properties: 1) it should be very fast to compute; NOTE: This is efficiency 2) it should minimize duplication of output values (collisions). NOTE: This is uniformity Hash functions rely on generating favorable probability distributions for their effectiveness, reducing access time to nearly constant. High table loading factors, pathological key sets and poorly designed hash functions can result in access times approaching linear in the number of items in the table. Hash functions can be designed to give best worst-case performance, good performance under high table loading factors, and in special cases, perfect (collisionless) mapping of keys into hash codes. Implementation is based on parity-preserving bit operations (XOR and ADD), multiply, or divide. A necessary adjunct to the hash function is a collision-resolution method that employs an auxiliary data structure like linked lists , or systematic probing of the table to find an empty slot.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Hash-function/#properties","text":"Note: Properties determine their usage, it is necessary to know the properties a hash function possess.","title":"Properties"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Hash-function/#uniformity","text":"Note: \u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 Hash table#Choosing a hash function \u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff1a A basic requirement is that the function should provide a uniform distribution of hash values. A good hash function should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range. That is, every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same probability . The reason for this last requirement is that the cost of hashing-based methods goes up sharply as the number of collisions \u2014pairs of inputs that are mapped to the same hash value \u2014increases. If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries. Note that this criterion only requires the value to be uniformly distributed , not random in any sense. A good randomizing function is (barring computational efficiency concerns) generally a good choice as a hash function , but the converse need not be true. NOTE: hash function VS randomizing function Hash tables often contain only a small subset of the valid inputs. For instance, a club membership list may contain only a hundred or so member names, out of the very large set of all possible names.

It also excludes functions that depend on the memory address of the object being hashed in cases that the address may change during execution (as may happen on systems that use certain methods of garbage collection ), although sometimes rehashing of the item is possible. The determinism is in the context of the reuse of the function. For example, Python adds the feature that hash functions make use of a randomized seed that is generated once when the Python process starts in addition to the input to be hashed. The Python hash is still a valid hash function when used within a single run.

Keys {3,15,27,39,...} will be hashed to bucket 3. Keys {6,18,30,42,...} will be hashed to bucket 6. Keys {9,21,33,45,...} will be hashed to bucket 9.

Imagine that the keys that are most likely to occur are the multiples of 3. In this case, all of the buckets that are not multiples of 3 will be empty with high probability (which is really bad in terms of hash table performance).

A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots , from which the desired value can be found.

Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key-value pairs, at ( amortized ) constant average cost per operation.

For this reason, they are widely used in many kinds of computer software , particularly for associative arrays , database indexing , caches , and sets . Hashing Main article: Hash function The idea of hashing is to distribute the entries (key/value pairs) across an array of buckets . Given a key, the algorithm computes an index that suggests where the entry can be found: index = f ( key , array_size ) Often this is done in two steps: hash = hashfunc ( key ) index = hash % array_size In this method, the hash is independent of the array size, and it is then reduced to an index (a number between 0 and array_size \u2212 1 ) using the modulo operator ( % ). In the case that the array size is a power of two , the remainder operation is reduced to masking , which improves speed, but can increase problems with a poor hash function.[ 5] NOTE: \u8fd9\u6307\u7684\u662f\u4f7f\u7528 bitmask \u6765\u66ff\u4ee3 modulo operation\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8ehash\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u79cdoptimization\u662f\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u5728 wikipedia Mask (computing) \u4e2d\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cdtechnique\u3002 Choosing a hash function NOTE: 1\u3001\u672c\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u7684\u662f: \u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2ahash map\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9hash function\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u8fd9\u4e00\u6bb5\u4f1a\u6d89\u53ca\"hash function\"\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u7136\u4e0e Hash-function \u7ae0\u8282\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u91cd\u590d\u3002 Uniform distribution A basic requirement is that the function should provide a uniform distribution \uff08\u79bb\u6563\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff09of hash values. The distribution needs to be uniform only for table sizes that occur in the application. In particular, if one uses dynamic resizing with exact doubling and halving of the table size, then the hash function needs to be uniform only when the size is a power of two . Here the index can be computed as some range of bits of the hash function. On the other hand, some hashing algorithms prefer to have the size be a prime number .[ 8] The modulus operation may provide some additional mixing; this is especially useful with a poor hash function.

If minimal perfect hashing is used, every location in the hash table can be used as well. Perfect hashing allows for constant time lookups in all cases. This is in contrast to most chaining and open addressing methods, where the time for lookup is low on average, but may be very large, O( n ), for instance when all the keys hash to a few values.

For example, if 2,450 keys are hashed into a million buckets, even with a perfectly uniform random distribution, according to the birthday problem there is approximately a 95% chance of at least two of the keys being hashed to the same slot. Therefore, almost all hash table implementations have some collision resolution strategy to handle such events. Some common strategies are described below. All these methods require that the keys (or pointers to them) be stored in the table, together with the associated values. Separate chaining In the method known as separate chaining , each bucket is independent, and has some sort of list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation.

Therefore, structures that are efficient in time and space for these cases are preferred. Structures that are efficient for a fairly large number of entries per bucket are not needed or desirable. If these cases happen often, the hashing function needs to be fixed.[ citation needed ] Separate chaining with linked lists NOTE: 1\u3001\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684hash table\uff0c\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aarray of linked list\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2amixed data structure Chained hash tables with linked lists are popular because they require only basic data structures with simple algorithms, and can use simple hash functions that are unsuitable for other methods.[ citation needed ] NOTE: 1\u3001\u4f18\u52bf\u5c31\u662f\u7b80\u5355 The cost of a table operation is that of scanning the entries of the selected bucket for the desired key. If the distribution of keys is sufficiently uniform , the average cost of a lookup depends only on the average number of keys per bucket\u2014that is, it is roughly proportional to the load factor. For this reason, chained hash tables remain effective even when the number of table entries n is much higher than the number of slots. For example, a chained hash table with 1000 slots and 10,000 stored keys (load factor 10) is five to ten times slower than a 10,000-slot table (load factor 1); but still 1000 times faster than a plain sequential list. For separate-chaining, the worst-case scenario is when all entries are inserted into the same bucket, in which case the hash table is ineffective and the cost is that of searching the bucket data structure. If the latter is a linear list, the lookup procedure may have to scan all its entries, so the worst-case cost is proportional to the number n of entries in the table. NOTE: 1\u3001\u6700\u574f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5 The bucket chains are often searched sequentially using the order the entries were added to the bucket. If the load factor is large and some keys are more likely to come up than others, then rearranging the chain with a move-to-front heuristic may be effective. More sophisticated data structures, such as balanced search trees, are worth considering only if the load factor is large (about 10 or more), or if the hash distribution is likely to be very non-uniform, or if one must guarantee good performance even in a worst-case scenario. However, using a larger table and/or a better hash function may be even more effective in those cases.[ citation needed ] \u52a3\u52bf NOTE: 1\u3001\u5b83\u7684\u52a3\u52bf\u6e90\u81ea\u4e8elinked list Chained hash tables also inherit the disadvantages of linked lists. When storing small keys and values, the space overhead of the next pointer in each entry record can be significant. An additional disadvantage is that traversing a linked list has poor cache performance , making the processor cache ineffective. Separate chaining with list head cells Some chaining implementations store the first record of each chain in the slot array itself.[ 4] The number of pointer traversals is decreased by one for most cases. The purpose is to increase cache efficiency of hash table access. The disadvantage is that an empty bucket takes the same space as a bucket with one entry. To save space, such hash tables often have about as many slots as stored entries, meaning that many slots have two or more entries.[ citation needed ] Separate chaining with other structures 1\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u975e\u5e38\u591a\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u6709\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u65b9\u6848 Using a self-balancing binary search tree : Instead of a list, one can use any other data structure that supports the required operations. For example, by using a self-balancing binary search tree , the theoretical worst-case time of common hash table operations (insertion, deletion, lookup) can be brought down to O(log n ) rather than O( n ). However, this introduces extra complexity into the implementation, and may cause even worse performance for smaller hash tables, where the time spent inserting into and balancing the tree is greater than the time needed to perform a linear search on all of the elements of a list.[ 3] [ 12] A real world example of a hash table that uses a self-balancing binary search tree for buckets is the HashMap class in Java version 8 .[ 13] NOTE: 1\u3001\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684hash table\uff0c\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aarray of self-balancing binary search tree \uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2amix data structure Using a dynamic array The variant called array hash table uses a dynamic array to store all the entries that hash to the same slot.[ 14] [ 15] [ 16] Each newly inserted entry gets appended to the end of the dynamic array that is assigned to the slot. The dynamic array is resized in an exact-fit manner, meaning it is grown only by as many bytes as needed. Alternative techniques such as growing the array by block sizes or pages were found to improve insertion performance, but at a cost in space. This variation makes more efficient use of CPU caching and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), because slot entries are stored in sequential memory positions. It also dispenses with the next pointers that are required by linked lists, which saves space. Despite frequent array resizing, space overheads incurred by the operating system such as memory fragmentation were found to be small.[ citation needed ] Dynamic perfect hashing NOTE: 1\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742 An elaboration on this approach is the so-called dynamic perfect hashing ,[ 17] where a bucket that contains k entries is organized as a perfect hash table with k*2 slots. While it uses more memory (*n*2 slots for *n entries, in the worst case and n \u00d7 k slots in the average case), this variant has guaranteed constant worst-case lookup time, and low amortized time for insertion. It is also possible to use a fusion tree for each bucket, achieving constant time for all operations with high probability.[ 18] Open addressing Main article: Open addressing In another strategy, called open addressing, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself. When a new entry has to be inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding in some probe sequence , until an unoccupied slot is found. When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table.[ 19] The name \"open addressing\" refers to the fact that the location (\"address\") of the item is not determined by its hash value. (This method is also called closed hashing ; it should not be confused with \"open hashing\" or \"closed addressing\" that usually mean separate chaining.) Well-known probe sequences include: 1\u3001 Linear probing , in which the interval between probes is fixed (usually 1). Because of good CPU cache utilization and high performance this algorithm is most widely used on modern computer architectures in hash table implementations.[ 20] 2\u3001 Quadratic probing , in which the interval between probes is increased by adding the successive outputs of a quadratic polynomial to the starting value given by the original hash computation 3\u3001 Double hashing , in which the interval between probes is computed by a second hash function NOTE: \u4e0b\u9762\u5bf9open addressing \u548c separate chaining\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u5f0f: linked \u548c array \u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4 Drawback A drawback of all these open addressing schemes is that the number of stored entries cannot exceed the number of slots in the bucket array. In fact, even with good hash functions, their performance dramatically degrades when the load factor grows beyond 0.7 or so. For many applications, these restrictions mandate the use of dynamic resizing, with its attendant costs.[ citation needed ] Drawback: clustering Open addressing schemes also put more stringent requirements on the hash function: besides distributing the keys more uniformly over the buckets, the function must also minimize the clustering of hash values that are consecutive in the probe order. Using separate chaining, the only concern is that too many objects map to the same hash value; whether they are adjacent or nearby is completely irrelevant.[ citation needed ] Dynamic resizing When an insert is made such that the number of entries in a hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the current capacity then the hash table will need to be rehashed .[ 9] Rehashing includes increasing the size of the underlying data structure[ 9] and mapping existing items to new bucket locations. In some implementations, if the initial capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash operations will ever occur.[ 9] NOTE: \u4e00\u3001\"mapping existing items to new bucket locations\" \u6307\u7684\u662f \u5bf9key\u91cd\u65b0\u4f7f\u7528hash function\u83b7\u5f97\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u7684hash code\uff0c\u5373rehash\u3001hash again\u3002 \u4e8c\u3001\u5176\u5b9edynamic resizing\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u800c\u8a00\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5bb9\u6613\u7684\uff0c\u5728 geeksforgeeks Load Factor and Rehashing \u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u603b\u7ed3: 1\u3001enlarge 2\u3001\u5c06\u539ftable\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u9010\u4e00\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u65b0\u7684table\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528 insert \u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u5373\u53ef: insert \u4f1a\u8ba1\u7b97hash code\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230hash table\u4e2d\u3002 To limit the proportion of memory wasted due to empty buckets, some implementations also shrink the size of the table\u2014followed by a rehash\u2014when items are deleted.

Then a new larger table is allocated , each entry is removed from the old table, and inserted into the new table. When all entries have been removed from the old table then the old table is returned to the free storage pool. Likewise, when the load factor falls below a second threshold *r min, all entries are moved to a new smaller table. For hash tables that shrink and grow frequently, the resizing downward(\u5411\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f) can be skipped entirely. In this case, the table size is proportional to the maximum number of entries that ever were in the hash table at one time, rather than the current number. The disadvantage is that memory usage will be higher, and thus cache behavior may be worse. For best control, a \"shrink-to-fit\" operation can be provided that does this only on request. If the table size increases or decreases by a fixed percentage at each expansion, the total cost of these resizings, amortized over all insert and delete operations, is still a constant, independent of the number of entries n and of the number m of operations performed. For example, consider a table that was created with the minimum possible size and is doubled each time the load ratio exceeds some threshold. If m elements are inserted into that table, the total number of extra re-insertions that occur in all dynamic resizings of the table is at most m \u2212 1. In other words, dynamic resizing roughly doubles the cost of each insert or delete operation. Alternatives to all-at-once rehashing Some hash table implementations, notably in real-time systems , cannot pay the price of enlarging the hash table all at once, because it may interrupt time-critical operations. If one cannot avoid dynamic resizing, a solution is to perform the resizing gradually \uff08\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\uff09.

To ensure that the old table is completely copied over before the new table itself needs to be enlarged, it is necessary to increase the size of the table by a factor of at least ( r + 1)/ r during resizing. Monotonic keys If it is known that keys will be stored in monotonically increasing (or decreasing) order, then a variation of consistent hashing can be achieved.

It is implemented using a single hash table, but with two possible lookup functions. Hashing for distributed hash tables Another way to decrease the cost of table resizing is to choose a hash function in such a way that the hashes of most values do not change when the table is resized. Such hash functions are prevalent\uff08\u6d41\u884c\u7684\uff09 in disk-based and distributed hash tables , where rehashing is prohibitively costly. The problem of designing a hash such that most values do not change when the table is resized is known as the distributed hash table problem. The four most popular approaches are rendezvous hashing , consistent hashing , the content addressable network algorithm, and Kademlia distance. NOTE: 1\u3001\u53c2\u89c1\u5de5\u7a0b Parallel-computing \u7684 Distributed-hash-table \u7ae0\u8282\u3002 Performance analysis In the simplest model, the hash function is completely unspecified and the table does not resize. With an ideal hash function, a table of size $ k $ with open addressing has no collisions and holds up to $ k $ elements with a single comparison for successful lookup, while a table of size $ k $ with chaining and $ n $ keys has the minimum $ max(0,n-k) $ collisions and $ \\Theta (1+{\\frac {n}{k}}) $ comparisons for lookup. With the worst possible hash function, every insertion causes a collision, and hash tables degenerate to linear search, with $ \\Theta (n) $ amortized comparisons per insertion and up to $ n $ comparisons for a successful lookup. Adding rehashing to this model is straightforward. As in a dynamic array , geometric resizing by a factor of $ b $ implies that only $ {\\frac {n}{b^{i}}} $keys are inserted $ i $ or more times, so that the total number of insertions is bounded above by $ {\\frac {bn}{b-1}} $, which is $ \\Theta (n) $. By using rehashing to maintain $ n<k $, tables using both chaining and open addressing can have unlimited elements and perform successful lookup in a single comparison for the best choice of hash function. In more realistic models, the hash function is a random variable over a probability distribution of hash functions, and performance is computed on average over the choice of hash function. When this distribution is uniform , the assumption is called \"simple uniform hashing\" and it can be shown that hashing with chaining requires $ \\Theta (1+{\\frac {n}{k}}) $ comparisons on average for an unsuccessful lookup, and hashing with open addressing requires $ \\Theta \\left({\\frac {1}{1-n/k}}\\right) .[[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#cite_note-26) Both these bounds are constant, if we maintain ' .[[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#cite_note-26) Both these bounds are constant, if we maintain ' {\\frac {n}{k}}<c $ using table resizing, where $ c $ is a fixed constant less than 1. Features Advantages 1\u3001The main advantage of hash tables over other table data structures is speed. This advantage is more apparent when the number of entries is large. Hash tables are particularly efficient when the maximum number of entries can be predicted in advance, so that the bucket array can be allocated once with the optimum size and never resized. NOTE: 1\u3001\u63d0\u524d\u77e5\u9053\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u662f\u5bf9\u5e94hash table\u800c\u8a00\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u3002 2\u3001If the set of key-value pairs is fixed and known ahead of time (so insertions and deletions are not allowed), one may reduce the average lookup cost by a careful choice of the hash function, bucket table size, and internal data structures. In particular, one may be able to devise a hash function that is collision-free, or even perfect. In this case the keys need not be stored in the table. Drawbacks 1\u3001Although operations on a hash table take constant time on average, the cost of a good hash function can be significantly higher than the inner loop of the lookup algorithm for a sequential list or search tree. Thus hash tables are not effective when the number of entries is very small. (However, in some cases the high cost of computing the hash function can be mitigated(\u7f13\u89e3) by saving the hash value together with the key.) NOTE: 1\u3001\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651hash function\u7684\u6210\u672c 2\u3001For certain string processing applications , such as spell-checking , hash tables may be less efficient than tries , finite automata , or Judy arrays . Also, if there are not too many possible keys to store\u2014that is, if each key can be represented by a small enough number of bits\u2014then, instead of a hash table, one may use the key directly as the index into an array of values. Note that there are no collisions in this case. NOTE: 1\u3001\u4f7f\u7528 tries \u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0 dict-map-associative-array 3\u3001The entries stored in a hash table can be enumerated efficiently (at constant cost per entry), but only in some pseudo-random order. Therefore, there is no efficient way to locate an entry whose key is nearest to a given key. Listing all n entries in some specific order generally requires a separate sorting step, whose cost is proportional to log( n ) per entry. In comparison, ordered search trees have lookup and insertion cost proportional to log( n ), but allow finding the nearest key at about the same cost, and ordered enumeration of all entries at constant cost per entry. NOTE: 1\u3001\u5176\u5b9e\u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u662f\u5728\u8bf4hash map\u662funsorted\u7684 4\u3001If the keys are not stored (because the hash function is collision-free), there may be no easy way to enumerate the keys that are present in the table at any given moment. 5\u3001Although the average cost per operation is constant and fairly small, the cost of a single operation may be quite high. In particular, if the hash table uses dynamic resizing , an insertion or deletion operation may occasionally take time proportional to the number of entries. This may be a serious drawback in real-time or interactive applications. 6\u3001Hash tables in general exhibit poor locality of reference \u2014that is, the data to be accessed is distributed seemingly at random in memory. Because hash tables cause access patterns that jump around, this can trigger microprocessor cache misses that cause long delays. Compact data structures such as arrays searched with linear search may be faster, if the table is relatively small and keys are compact. The optimal performance point varies from system to system. NOTE: 1\u3001cache performance\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5bb9 7\u3001Hash tables become quite inefficient when there are many collisions. While extremely uneven hash distributions are extremely unlikely to arise by chance, a malicious adversary with knowledge of the hash function may be able to supply information to a hash that creates worst-case behavior by causing excessive collisions, resulting in very poor performance, e.g., a denial of service attack .[ 27] [ 28] [ 29] In critical applications, a data structure with better worst-case guarantees can be used; however, universal hashing \u2014a randomized algorithm that prevents the attacker from predicting which inputs cause worst-case behavior\u2014may be preferable.[ 30] The hash function used by the hash table in the Linux routing table cache was changed with Linux version 2.4.2 as a countermeasure against such attacks.[ 31] Uses Associative arrays Main article: Associative array Database indexing Hash tables may also be used as disk -based data structures and database indices (such as in dbm ) although B-trees are more popular in these applications. In multi-node database systems, hash tables are commonly used to distribute rows amongst nodes, reducing network traffic for hash joins. Caches Main article: Cache (computing) Hash tables can be used to implement caches , auxiliary data tables that are used to speed up the access to data that is primarily stored in slower media. In this application, hash collisions can be handled by discarding one of the two colliding entries\u2014usually erasing the old item that is currently stored in the table and overwriting it with the new item, so every item in the table has a unique hash value. Sets Besides recovering the entry that has a given key, many hash table implementations can also tell whether such an entry exists or not. Those structures can therefore be used to implement a set data structure , which merely records whether a given key belongs to a specified set of keys. In this case, the structure can be simplified by eliminating all parts that have to do with the entry values. Hashing can be used to implement both static and dynamic sets. Object representation Several dynamic languages, such as Perl , Python , JavaScript , Lua , and Ruby , use hash tables to implement objects. In this representation, the keys are the names of the members and methods of the object, and the values are pointers to the corresponding member or method. Unique data representation Main article: String interning Hash tables can be used by some programs to avoid creating multiple character strings with the same contents. For that purpose, all strings in use by the program are stored in a single string pool implemented as a hash table, which is checked whenever a new string has to be created. This technique was introduced in Lisp interpreters under the name hash consing , and can be used with many other kinds of data ( expression trees in a symbolic algebra system, records in a database, files in a file system, binary decision diagrams, etc.).

If the distribution of keys is sufficiently uniform , the average cost of a lookup depends only on the average number of keys per bucket\u2014that is, it is roughly proportional to the load factor. For this reason, chained hash tables remain effective even when the number of table entries n is much higher than the number of slots. For example, a chained hash table with 1000 slots and 10,000 stored keys (load factor 10) is five to ten times slower than a 10,000-slot table (load factor 1); but still 1000 times faster than a plain sequential list. For separate-chaining, the worst-case scenario is when all entries are inserted into the same bucket, in which case the hash table is ineffective and the cost is that of searching the bucket data structure. If the latter is a linear list, the lookup procedure may have to scan all its entries, so the worst-case cost is proportional to the number n of entries in the table. NOTE: 1\u3001\u6700\u574f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5 The bucket chains are often searched sequentially using the order the entries were added to the bucket. If the load factor is large and some keys are more likely to come up than others, then rearranging the chain with a move-to-front heuristic may be effective. More sophisticated data structures, such as balanced search trees, are worth considering only if the load factor is large (about 10 or more), or if the hash distribution is likely to be very non-uniform, or if one must guarantee good performance even in a worst-case scenario.

For example, by using a self-balancing binary search tree , the theoretical worst-case time of common hash table operations (insertion, deletion, lookup) can be brought down to O(log n ) rather than O( n ). However, this introduces extra complexity into the implementation, and may cause even worse performance for smaller hash tables, where the time spent inserting into and balancing the tree is greater than the time needed to perform a linear search on all of the elements of a list.[ 3] [ 12] A real world example of a hash table that uses a self-balancing binary search tree for buckets is the HashMap class in Java version 8 .[ 13] NOTE: 1\u3001\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684hash table\uff0c\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aarray of self-balancing binary search tree \uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2amix data structure Using a dynamic array The variant called array hash table uses a dynamic array to store all the entries that hash to the same slot.[ 14] [ 15] [ 16] Each newly inserted entry gets appended to the end of the dynamic array that is assigned to the slot. The dynamic array is resized in an exact-fit manner, meaning it is grown only by as many bytes as needed. Alternative techniques such as growing the array by block sizes or pages were found to improve insertion performance, but at a cost in space. This variation makes more efficient use of CPU caching and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), because slot entries are stored in sequential memory positions. It also dispenses with the next pointers that are required by linked lists, which saves space. Despite frequent array resizing, space overheads incurred by the operating system such as memory fragmentation were found to be small.[ citation needed ] Dynamic perfect hashing NOTE: 1\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u590d\u6742 An elaboration on this approach is the so-called dynamic perfect hashing ,[ 17] where a bucket that contains k entries is organized as a perfect hash table with k*2 slots. While it uses more memory (*n*2 slots for *n entries, in the worst case and n \u00d7 k slots in the average case), this variant has guaranteed constant worst-case lookup time, and low amortized time for insertion. It is also possible to use a fusion tree for each bucket, achieving constant time for all operations with high probability.[ 18]","title":"Separate chaining with other structures"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Hash-table/wikipedia-Hash-table/#open#addressing","text":"Main article: Open addressing In another strategy, called open addressing, all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself.

When searching for an entry, the buckets are scanned in the same sequence, until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table.[ 19] The name \"open addressing\" refers to the fact that the location (\"address\") of the item is not determined by its hash value.

Then a new larger table is allocated , each entry is removed from the old table, and inserted into the new table. When all entries have been removed from the old table then the old table is returned to the free storage pool. Likewise, when the load factor falls below a second threshold *r min, all entries are moved to a new smaller table. For hash tables that shrink and grow frequently, the resizing downward(\u5411\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f) can be skipped entirely. In this case, the table size is proportional to the maximum number of entries that ever were in the hash table at one time, rather than the current number. The disadvantage is that memory usage will be higher, and thus cache behavior may be worse. For best control, a \"shrink-to-fit\" operation can be provided that does this only on request. If the table size increases or decreases by a fixed percentage at each expansion, the total cost of these resizings, amortized over all insert and delete operations, is still a constant, independent of the number of entries n and of the number m of operations performed. For example, consider a table that was created with the minimum possible size and is doubled each time the load ratio exceeds some threshold. If m elements are inserted into that table, the total number of extra re-insertions that occur in all dynamic resizings of the table is at most m \u2212 1.

Thus hash tables are not effective when the number of entries is very small. (However, in some cases the high cost of computing the hash function can be mitigated(\u7f13\u89e3) by saving the hash value together with the key.)

Also, if there are not too many possible keys to store\u2014that is, if each key can be represented by a small enough number of bits\u2014then, instead of a hash table, one may use the key directly as the index into an array of values.

Therefore, there is no efficient way to locate an entry whose key is nearest to a given key. Listing all n entries in some specific order generally requires a separate sorting step, whose cost is proportional to log( n ) per entry. In comparison, ordered search trees have lookup and insertion cost proportional to log( n ), but allow finding the nearest key at about the same cost, and ordered enumeration of all entries at constant cost per entry.

In particular, if the hash table uses dynamic resizing , an insertion or deletion operation may occasionally take time proportional to the number of entries. This may be a serious drawback in real-time or interactive applications. 6\u3001Hash tables in general exhibit poor locality of reference \u2014that is, the data to be accessed is distributed seemingly at random in memory. Because hash tables cause access patterns that jump around, this can trigger microprocessor cache misses that cause long delays. Compact data structures such as arrays searched with linear search may be faster, if the table is relatively small and keys are compact. The optimal performance point varies from system to system.

When the top hash is available, the hash list can be received from any non-trusted source, like any peer in the p2p network. Then the received hash list is checked against the trusted top hash, and if the hash list is damaged or fake, another hash list from another source will be tried until the program finds one that matches the top hash. Applications Hash lists can be used to protect any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. An important use of hash lists is to make sure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and to check that the other peers do not \"lie\" and send fake blocks. Usually a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 is used for the hashing. If the hash list only needs to protect against unintentional damage unsecured checksums such as CRCs can be used.

With only a hash of the file, many undamaged blocks would have to be redownloaded, and the file reconstructed and tested until the correct hash of the entire file is obtained. Hash lists also protect against nodes that try to sabotage by sending fake blocks, since in such a case the damaged block can be acquired from some other source. Hash chain A hash chain is the successive application of a cryptographic hash function to a piece of data. Definition A hash chain is a successive application of a cryptographic hash function $ h $ to a string $ x $.

You then take the result and hash that too. You continue hashing the results repeatedly, till you have a series of hashes like this: Base -> Hash0 = H(Base) -> Hash1 = H(Hash0) -> ... -> HashN = H(HashN-1) The exciting property of these hash chains is that given the last hash in the chain, HashN, it is very difficult to determine any of the previous hashes, or the base. However, given the last hash, it is trivial to verify whether another hash is part of the chain. This means that a hash chain has the potential to be a limited source of authentication. You can deploy a resource in public along with the last hash of the chain. Then you can give commands to this resource, passing along each previous hash as authentication of your identity.

Uses Hash trees can be used to verify any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. They can help ensure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks.

Nodes further up in the tree are the hashes of their respective children. For example, in the picture hash 0 is the result of hashing the concatenation of hash 0-0 and hash 0-1 . That is, hash 0 = hash( hash(0-0) + hash(0-1) ) where + denotes concatenation . Usually, a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-2 is used for the hashing. If the hash tree only needs to protect against unintentional damage, unsecured checksums such as CRCs can be used. In the top of a hash tree there is a top hash (or root hash or master hash ). Before downloading a file on a p2p network, in most cases the top hash is acquired from a trusted source, for instance a friend or a web site that is known to have good recommendations of files to download.

You then take the result and hash that too. You continue hashing the results repeatedly, till you have a series of hashes like this: Base -> Hash0 = H(Base) -> Hash1 = H(Hash0) -> ... -> HashN = H(HashN-1) The exciting property of these hash chains is that given the last hash in the chain, HashN, it is very difficult to determine any of the previous hashes, or the base. However, given the last hash, it is trivial to verify whether another hash is part of the chain. This means that a hash chain has the potential to be a limited source of authentication. You can deploy a resource in public along with the last hash of the chain. Then you can give commands to this resource, passing along each previous hash as authentication of your identity.","title":"Pre-image resistance / one-way"},{"location":"Data-structure/Hash/Merkle-tree/#immutable","text":"\u7be1\u6539 Hash chain \u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2anode\uff08\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u7684hash value\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u540e\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7684hash value\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u904d\u624d\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u6210\u94fe\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210hash chain\u4e86\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u4e2d\u6574\u4e2a Hash chain \u662fimmutable\u7684\u3002 \u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u5bfb\u627e\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0e\u6b64\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff1a Where did the idea of blockchain come from?

elements in each node. It can dramatically increase cache performance, while decreasing the memory overhead associated with storing list metadata such as references . It is related to the B-tree . Overview A typical unrolled linked list node looks like this: record node { node next // reference to next node in list int numElements // number of elements in this node, up to maxElements array elements // an array of numElements elements, // with space allocated for maxElements elements } Each node holds up to a certain maximum number of elements, typically just large enough so that the node fills a single cache line or a small multiple thereof. A position in the list is indicated by both a reference to the node and a position in the elements array. It is also possible to include a previous pointer for an unrolled doubly linked list . NOTE: 1\u3001\"align-to-cache line-optimization\" To insert a new element, we simply find the node the element should be in and insert the element into the elements array, incrementing numElements . If the array is already full, we first insert a new node either preceding or following the current one and move half of the elements in the current node into it. To remove an element, we simply find the node it is in and delete it from the elements array, decrementing numElements . If this reduces the node to less than half-full, then we move elements from the next node to fill it back up above half. If this leaves the next node less than half full, then we move all its remaining elements into the current node, then bypass and delete it.

Thus it can get the best of array (for searching) while maintaining a linked list -like structure that allows insertion- which is not possible in an array. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences , with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one (see the picture below on the right). Searching starts in the sparsest(\u7a00\u758f\u7684) subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for. Via the linked hierarchy, these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence, where searching is continued until finally we are searching in the full sequence. The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically [ 2] or deterministically,[ 3] with the former being more common.

Each box with an arrow represents a pointer and a row is a linked list giving a sparse subsequence; the numbered boxes (in yellow) at the bottom represent the ordered data sequence. Searching proceeds downwards from the sparsest subsequence at the top until consecutive elements bracketing the search element are found. Inserting elements to skip list A search for a target element begins at the head element in the top list , and proceeds horizontally\uff08\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\uff09 until the current element is greater than or equal to the target. If the current element is equal to the target, it has been found. If the current element is greater than the target, or the search reaches the end of the linked list, the procedure is repeated after returning to the previous element and dropping down vertically to the next lower list. The expected number of steps in each linked list is at most {\\displaystyle 1/p} {\\displaystyle 1/p} , which can be seen by tracing the search path backwards from the target until reaching an element that appears in the next higher list or reaching the beginning of the current list. Therefore, the total expected cost of a search is {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{p}}\\log _{1/p}n} {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{p}}\\log _{1/p}n} which is {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(\\log n)\\,} {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(\\log n)\\,} , when {\\displaystyle p} {\\displaystyle p} is a constant.

Implementation details The elements used for a skip list can contain more than one pointer since they can participate in more than one list. Insertions and deletions are implemented much like the corresponding linked-list operations, except that \"tall\" elements must be inserted into or deleted from more than one linked list. ${\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(n)} $operations, which force us to visit every node in ascending order (such as printing the entire list), provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-list in an optimal way, bringing the skip list to {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(\\log n)} {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}(\\log n)} search time.

Thus it can get the best of array (for searching) while maintaining a linked list -like structure that allows insertion- which is not possible in an array. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences , with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one (see the picture below on the right). Searching starts in the sparsest(\u7a00\u758f\u7684) subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for. Via the linked hierarchy, these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence, where searching is continued until finally we are searching in the full sequence. The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically [ 2] or deterministically,[ 3] with the former being more common.

Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.

Static sets allow only query operations on their elements \u2014 such as checking whether a given value is in the set, or enumerating the values in some arbitrary order.

Implementations Sets can be implemented using various data structures , which provide different time and space trade-offs for various operations. Some implementations are designed to improve the efficiency of very specialized operations, such as nearest or union . Implementations described as \"general use\" typically strive to optimize the element_of , add , and delete operations. A simple implementation is to use a list , ignoring the order of the elements and taking care to avoid repeated values.

A sorted linear hash table[ 8] may be used to provide deterministically ordered sets. Further, in languages that support maps but not sets, sets can be implemented in terms of maps.

All these operations of SpecialStack must be O(1). To implement SpecialStack , you should only use standard Stack data structure and no other data structure like arrays, list, .. etc. Example: Consider the following SpecialStack 16 --> TOP 15 29 19 18 When getMin() is called it should return 15, which is the minimum element in the current stack. If we do pop two times on stack, the stack becomes 29 --> TOP 19 18 When getMin() is called, it should return 18 which is the minimum in the current stack. Recommended: Please solve it on \u201c***PRACTICE***\u201d first, before moving on to the solution. \u7b97\u6cd5 An approach that uses O(1) time and O(n) extra space is discussed here . In this article, a new approach is discussed that supports minimum with O(1) extra space. We define a variable minEle that stores the current minimum element in the stack. Now the interesting part is, how to handle the case when minimum element is removed. To handle this, we push \u201c2x \u2013 minEle\u201d into the stack instead of x so that previous minimum element can be retrieved using current minEle and its value stored in stack. Below are detailed steps and explanation of working. Push(x) Inserts x at the top of stack. If stack is empty, insert x into the stack and make minEle equal to x . If stack is not empty, compare x with minEle . Two cases arise: If x is greater than or equal to minEle , simply insert x . If x is less than minEle , insert (2*x \u2013 minEle) into the stack and make minEle equal to x . For example, let previous minEle was 3. Now we want to insert 2. We update minEle as 2 and insert 2*2 \u2013 3 = 1 into the stack.

Let the removed element be y. Two cases arise: If y is greater than or equal to minEle, the minimum element in the stack is still minEle.

This problem can be solved efficiently both by parallel and non-parallel algorithms: Berkman, Schieber & Vishkin (1993) , who first identified the procedure as a useful subroutine for other parallel programs, developed efficient algorithms to solve it in the Parallel Random Access Machine model; it may also be solved in linear time on a non-parallel computer using a stack -based algorithm. Later researchers have studied algorithms to solve it in other models of parallel computation. Example Suppose that the input is the binary van der Corput sequence 0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15. The first element of the sequence (0) has no previous value. The nearest (only) smaller value previous to 8 and to 4 is 0. All three values previous to 12 are smaller, but the nearest one is 4. Continuing in the same way, the nearest previous smaller values for this sequence (indicating the nonexistence of a previous smaller value by a dash) are \u2014, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 6, 0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 3, 3, 7. In most applications, the positions of the nearest smaller values , and not the values themselves, should be computed, and in many applications the same computation should be computed for the reversal of the sequence in order to find the following smaller value that is closest in the sequence. Applications Berkman, Schieber & Vishkin (1993) mention many other problems that may be solved efficiently in parallel using a nearest smaller values computation. Among them, they include the following: 1\u3001 Merge algorithms , computing the merge step of a merge sort . The input to these algorithms consists of two sorted arrays of numbers; the desired output is the same set of numbers in a single sorted array. If one concatenates the two sorted arrays, the first in ascending order and the second in descending order, then the predecessor(\u524d\u9a71) of each value in the output is either its closest previous smaller value or its closest following smaller value (whichever of the two is larger), and the position of each value in the sorted output array may easily be calculated from the positions of these two nearest smaller values. 2\u3001Construction of Cartesian trees . A Cartesian tree is a data structure introduced by Vuillemin (1980) and further studied by Gabow, Bentley & Tarjan (1984) for range searching applications. Cartesian trees also arise in the definition of the treap and randomized binary search tree data structures for binary searching . The Cartesian tree of a sequence of values has a node for each value. The root of the tree is the minimum value of the sequence; for every other node, the parent of the node is either its closest previous smaller value or its closest following smaller value (whichever of the two exists and is larger). Thus, Cartesian trees may be constructed in linear time based on an all nearest smaller values algorithm. 3\u3001Matching parentheses . If a sequence of open and close parenthesis characters is given as input, together with the nesting depth of each parenthesis, then the match to each open parenthesis is the next close parenthesis with no larger nesting depth, so it can be found by an all nearest smaller values computation that breaks ties in favor of close parentheses. If the nesting depths are not given, they can be calculated using a prefix sum computation.

In pseudocode , the algorithm is as follows. S = new empty stack data structure for x in the input sequence: while S is nonempty and the top element of S is greater than or equal to x: pop S if S is empty: x has no preceding smaller value else: the nearest smaller value to x is the top element of S push x onto S NOTE: \u4e00\u3001\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e76\u4e14\u6bd4\u6211\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u663e\u7136\u5b83\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\uff1a 1\u3001\u6700\u8fd1 2\u3001\u6bd4\u6211\u5c0f\uff08\u80af\u5b9a\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09 \u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8981\u641e\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u6700\u503c\u662f\u5728**\u6700\u8fd1**\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728**\u6700\u5c0f**\u4e0a\uff0c\u6808\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u540e\u8fdb\u5148\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u6027\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u9700\u6c42\u7684**\u6700\u8fd1**\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u6808\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0b\u6765(\u8fd9\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684)\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4ece\u6808\u9876\u5230\u6808\u5e95\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b83\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u8fdc\uff1b\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u7684\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7279\u6027\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6pop\uff0c\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6240\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6808\u9876\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff1a while S is nonempty and the top element of S is greater than or equal to x: pop S \u8fd9\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u51fa\u6808\uff0c\u672c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u6c42**\u6700\u8fd1\u6bd4\u6211\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20**\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6b64\u65f6\u6808\u9876\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fd8\u6bd4\u6211\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u663e\u7136\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u65e2\u6ca1\u6709\u6211\u66f4\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6211\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b83\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06**\u4ed6\u4eec**\u5168\u90e8pop\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u4ed6\u4eec\u90fd\u6dd8\u6c70\uff1b \u5f53\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6b64\u65f6\u6808\u9876\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4\u6211\u8fd8\u5c0f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u80fd\u591f\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b83\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6309\u7167\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6211\u66f4\u52a0\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u66f4\u5927\u3002 \u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u51e0\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff1a 1 \u3001 2 \u3001 3 \u3001 4 \u3001 5 \u3001 6 \u3001 7 \u3001 8 \u3001 1 \u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u662f\u5e8f\u5217\u662f\u9012\u589e\u7684\uff0c\u663e\u7136\uff0c\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u538b\u6808\u77e5\u9053\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a1\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u4f1a\u63a5\u5165 while \u5faa\u73af\uff0c while \u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u505c\u5730\u51fa\u6808\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6808\u4e3a\u7a7a\uff1b 2 \u3001 3 \u3001 4 \u3001 5 \u3001 6 \u3001 7 \u3001 8 \u3001 9 \u3001 1 Computation complexity Despite having a nested loop structure, the running time of this algorithm is linear, because every iteration of the inner loop removes an item that had been added in some previous iteration of the outer loop.

Among them, they include the following: 1\u3001 Merge algorithms , computing the merge step of a merge sort . The input to these algorithms consists of two sorted arrays of numbers; the desired output is the same set of numbers in a single sorted array. If one concatenates the two sorted arrays, the first in ascending order and the second in descending order, then the predecessor(\u524d\u9a71) of each value in the output is either its closest previous smaller value or its closest following smaller value (whichever of the two is larger), and the position of each value in the sorted output array may easily be calculated from the positions of these two nearest smaller values. 2\u3001Construction of Cartesian trees . A Cartesian tree is a data structure introduced by Vuillemin (1980) and further studied by Gabow, Bentley & Tarjan (1984) for range searching applications. Cartesian trees also arise in the definition of the treap and randomized binary search tree data structures for binary searching . The Cartesian tree of a sequence of values has a node for each value. The root of the tree is the minimum value of the sequence; for every other node, the parent of the node is either its closest previous smaller value or its closest following smaller value (whichever of the two exists and is larger). Thus, Cartesian trees may be constructed in linear time based on an all nearest smaller values algorithm. 3\u3001Matching parentheses . If a sequence of open and close parenthesis characters is given as input, together with the nesting depth of each parenthesis, then the match to each open parenthesis is the next close parenthesis with no larger nesting depth, so it can be found by an all nearest smaller values computation that breaks ties in favor of close parentheses. If the nesting depths are not given, they can be calculated using a prefix sum computation.

wikipedia Stack-sortable permutation In mathematics and computer science , a stack-sortable permutation (also called a tree permutation )[ 1] is a permutation whose elements may be sorted by an algorithm whose internal storage is limited to a single stack data structure . The stack-sortable permutations are exactly the permutations that do not contain the permutation pattern 231; they are counted by the Catalan numbers , and may be placed in bijection with many other combinatorial objects with the same counting function including Dyck paths and binary trees .

For instance, the sequence 3,2,1 is correctly sorted: the three elements are all pushed onto the stack, and then popped in the order 1,2,3. However, the sequence 2,3,1 is not correctly sorted: the algorithm first pushes 2, and pops it when it sees the larger input value 3, causing 2 to be output before 1 rather than after it. NOTE: 1\u3001\u601d\u8003: \u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u5224\u65ad\uff1f\u540e\u9762\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5224\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5 Because this algorithm is a comparison sort , its success or failure does not depend on the numerical values of the input sequence, but only on their relative order; that is, an input may be described by the permutation needed to form that input from a sorted sequence of the same length. Knuth characterized the permutations that this algorithm correctly sorts as being exactly the permutations that do not contain the permutation pattern 231: three elements x , y , and z , appearing in the input in that respective order, with z < x < y . Moreover, he observed that, if the algorithm fails to sort an input, then that input cannot be sorted with a single stack.

An array A[] is said to be stack sortable if it can be stored in another array B[] , using a temporary stack S . The operations that are allowed on array are: 1\u3001Remove the starting element of array A[] and push it into the stack. 2\u3001Remove the top element of the stack S and append it to the end of array B . If all the element of A[] can be moved to B[] by performing these operations such that array B is sorted in ascending\uff08\u5347\u5e8f\uff09 order, then array A[] is stack sortable . Examples: Input : A[] = { 3, 2, 1 } Output : YES Explanation : Step 1: Remove the starting element of array A[] and push it in the stack S. ( Operation 1) That makes A[] = { 2, 1 } ; Stack S = { 3 } Step 2: Operation 1 That makes A[] = { 1 } Stack S = { 3, 2 } Step 3: Operation 1 That makes A[] = {} Stack S = { 3, 2, 1 } Step 4: Operation 2 That makes Stack S = { 3, 2 } B[] = { 1 } Step 5: Operation 2 That makes Stack S = { 3 } B[] = { 1, 2 } Step 6: Operation 2 That makes Stack S = {} B[] = { 1, 2, 3 } Input : A[] = { 2, 3, 1} Output : NO \u7b97\u6cd5 Given, array A[] is a permutation of [1, \u2026, N] , so let us suppose the initially B[] = {0} .

The task is to check whether the given Queue elements can be arranged in increasing order in another Queue using a stack. The operation allowed are: \\1. Push and pop elements from the stack \\2. Pop (Or enqueue) from the given Queue. \\3. Push (Or Dequeue) in the another Queue. Examples Input : Queue[] = { 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 } Output : Yes Pop the first element of the given Queue i.e 5. Push 5 into the stack. Now, pop all the elements of the given Queue and push them to second Queue. Now, pop element 5 in the stack and push it to the second Queue. Input : Queue[] = { 5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4 } Output : No Push 5 to stack. Pop 1, 2 from given Queue and push it to another Queue. Pop 6 from given Queue and push to stack. Pop 3, 4 from given Queue and push to second Queue. Now, from using any of above operation, we cannot push 5 into the second Queue because it is below the 6 in the stack. \u7b97\u6cd5 Observe, second Queue (which will contain the sorted element) takes inputs (or enqueue elements) either from given Queue or Stack. So, next expected (which will initially be 1) element must be present as a front element of given Queue or top element of the Stack. So, simply simulate the process for the second Queue by initializing the expected element as 1. And check if we can get expected element from the front of the given Queue or from the top of the Stack. If we cannot take it from the either of them then pop the front element of given Queue and push it in the Stack. Also, observe, that the stack must also be sorted at each instance i.e the element at the top of the stack must be smallest in the stack. For eg. let x > y, then x will always be expected before y. So, x cannot be pushed before y in the stack. Therefore, we cannot push element with the higher value on the top of the element having lesser value. Algorithm: \\1. Initialize the expected_element = 1 \\2. Check if either front element of given Queue or top element of the stack have expected_element \u2026.a) If yes, increment expected_element by 1, repeat step 2. \u2026.b) Else, pop front of Queue and push it to the stack. If the popped element is greater than top of the Stack, return \u201cNo\u201d.

So, next expected (which will initially be 1) element must be present as a front element of given Queue or top element of the Stack. So, simply simulate the process for the second Queue by initializing the expected element as 1. And check if we can get expected element from the front of the given Queue or from the top of the Stack. If we cannot take it from the either of them then pop the front element of given Queue and push it in the Stack. Also, observe, that the stack must also be sorted at each instance i.e the element at the top of the stack must be smallest in the stack. For eg. let x > y, then x will always be expected before y. So, x cannot be pushed before y in the stack. Therefore, we cannot push element with the higher value on the top of the element having lesser value. Algorithm: \\1.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO ( last in, first out ). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack. The name \"stack\" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first. Considered as a linear data structure , or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. This makes it possible to implement a stack as a singly linked list and a pointer to the top element. A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack. A stack is needed to implement depth-first search . Applications of stacks Expression evaluation and syntax parsing Calculators employing reverse Polish notation use a stack structure to hold values. Expressions can be represented in prefix, postfix or infix notations and conversion from one form to another may be accomplished using a stack. Many compilers use a stack for parsing the syntax of expressions, program blocks etc. before translating into low level code. Most programming languages are context-free languages , allowing them to be parsed with stack based machines. Backtracking Main article: Backtracking Another important application of stacks is backtracking . Consider a simple example of finding the correct path in a maze. There are a series of points, from the starting point to the destination. We start from one point. To reach the final destination, there are several paths. Suppose we choose a random path. After following a certain path, we realise that the path we have chosen is wrong. So we need to find a way by which we can return to the beginning of that path. This can be done with the use of stacks. With the help of stacks, we remember the point where we have reached. This is done by pushing that point into the stack. In case we end up on the wrong path, we can pop the last point from the stack and thus return to the last point and continue our quest to find the right path. This is called backtracking. The prototypical example of a backtracking algorithm is depth-first search , which finds all vertices of a graph that can be reached from a specified starting vertex. Other applications of backtracking involve searching through spaces that represent potential solutions to an optimization problem. Branch and bound is a technique for performing such backtracking searches without exhaustively searching all of the potential solutions in such a space. Compile time memory management Main articles: Stack-based memory allocation and Stack machine A number of programming languages are stack-oriented , meaning they define most basic operations (adding two numbers, printing a character) as taking their arguments from the stack, and placing any return values back on the stack. For example, PostScript has a return stack and an operand stack, and also has a graphics state stack and a dictionary stack. Many virtual machines are also stack-oriented, including the p-code machine and the Java Virtual Machine . Almost all calling conventions \u200d\u2014\u200cthe ways in which subroutines receive their parameters and return results\u200d\u2014\u200cuse a special stack (the \" call stack \") to hold information about procedure/function calling and nesting in order to switch to the context of the called function and restore to the caller function when the calling finishes. The functions follow a runtime protocol between caller and callee to save arguments and return value on the stack. Stacks are an important way of supporting nested or recursive function calls. This type of stack is used implicitly by the compiler to support CALL and RETURN statements (or their equivalents) and is not manipulated directly by the programmer. Some programming languages use the stack to store data that is local to a procedure. Space for local data items is allocated from the stack when the procedure is entered, and is deallocated when the procedure exits. The C programming language is typically implemented in this way. Using the same stack for both data and procedure calls has important security implications (see below) of which a programmer must be aware in order to avoid introducing serious security bugs into a program. Efficient algorithms Several algorithms use a stack (separate from the usual function call stack of most programming languages) as the principle data structure with which they organize their information. These include: Graham scan , an algorithm for the convex hull of a two-dimensional system of points. A convex hull of a subset of the input is maintained in a stack, which is used to find and remove concavities in the boundary when a new point is added to the hull.[ 10] Part of the SMAWK algorithm for finding the row minima of a monotone matrix uses stacks in a similar way to Graham scan.[ 11] All nearest smaller values , the problem of finding, for each number in an array, the closest preceding number that is smaller than it. One algorithm for this problem uses a stack to maintain a collection of candidates for the nearest smaller value. For each position in the array, the stack is popped until a smaller value is found on its top, and then the value in the new position is pushed onto the stack.[ 12] The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm , a method for agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on maintaining a stack of clusters, each of which is the nearest neighbor of its predecessor on the stack. When this method finds a pair of clusters that are mutual nearest neighbors, they are popped and merged.[ 13] NOTE: \u6808\u7684\u540e\u8fdb\u5148\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5012\u5e8f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9b\u9700\u8981\u6267\u884c\u9006\u8f6c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b Security Some computing environments use stacks in ways that may make them vulnerable to security breaches and attacks. Programmers working in such environments must take special care to avoid the pitfalls of these implementations. For example, some programming languages use a common stack to store both data local to a called procedure and the linking information that allows the procedure to return to its caller. This means that the program moves data into and out of the same stack that contains critical return addresses for the procedure calls. If data is moved to the wrong location on the stack, or an oversized data item is moved to a stack location that is not large enough to contain it, return information for procedure calls may be corrupted, causing the program to fail. Malicious parties may attempt a stack smashing attack that takes advantage of this type of implementation by providing oversized data input to a program that does not check the length of input. Such a program may copy the data in its entirety to a location on the stack, and in so doing it may change the return addresses for procedures that have called it. An attacker can experiment to find a specific type of data that can be provided to such a program such that the return address of the current procedure is reset to point to an area within the stack itself (and within the data provided by the attacker), which in turn contains instructions that carry out unauthorized operations. This type of attack is a variation on the buffer overflow attack and is an extremely frequent source of security breaches in software, mainly because some of the most popular compilers use a shared stack for both data and procedure calls, and do not verify the length of data items. Frequently programmers do not write code to verify the size of data items, either, and when an oversized or undersized data item is copied to the stack, a security breach may occur.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Stack/wikipedia-Stack%28abstract-data-type%29/#wikipedia#stack#abstract#data#type","text":"In computer science , a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push , which adds an element to the collection, and pop , which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

When this method finds a pair of clusters that are mutual nearest neighbors, they are popped and merged.[ 13] NOTE: \u6808\u7684\u540e\u8fdb\u5148\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5012\u5e8f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9b\u9700\u8981\u6267\u884c\u9006\u8f6c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b","title":"Efficient algorithms"},{"location":"Data-structure/Stack/wikipedia-Stack%28abstract-data-type%29/#security","text":"Some computing environments use stacks in ways that may make them vulnerable to security breaches and attacks. Programmers working in such environments must take special care to avoid the pitfalls of these implementations. For example, some programming languages use a common stack to store both data local to a called procedure and the linking information that allows the procedure to return to its caller. This means that the program moves data into and out of the same stack that contains critical return addresses for the procedure calls. If data is moved to the wrong location on the stack, or an oversized data item is moved to a stack location that is not large enough to contain it, return information for procedure calls may be corrupted, causing the program to fail. Malicious parties may attempt a stack smashing attack that takes advantage of this type of implementation by providing oversized data input to a program that does not check the length of input. Such a program may copy the data in its entirety to a location on the stack, and in so doing it may change the return addresses for procedures that have called it. An attacker can experiment to find a specific type of data that can be provided to such a program such that the return address of the current procedure is reset to point to an area within the stack itself (and within the data provided by the attacker), which in turn contains instructions that carry out unauthorized operations. This type of attack is a variation on the buffer overflow attack and is an extremely frequent source of security breaches in software, mainly because some of the most popular compilers use a shared stack for both data and procedure calls, and do not verify the length of data items. Frequently programmers do not write code to verify the size of data items, either, and when an oversized or undersized data item is copied to the stack, a security breach may occur.","title":"Security"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/","text":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7ae0 \u672c\u7ae0\u8bb2\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002 algorithm to judge whether two string has substring in common Finding all the common substrings of given two strings Check if two strings have a common substring longest common substring problem suffix tree suffix tree Ukkonen's suffix tree algorithm in plain English https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/suffix-tree?tab=Active \u4f7f\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb \u4e00\u79cdpython\u5b9e\u73b0 def get_num_of_word_in_common ( word1 , word2 ): \"\"\"\u516c\u5171\u8bcd\u7684\u4e2a\u6570\"\"\" return len ( Counter ( word1 ) & Counter ( word2 ))","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/#_1","text":"\u672c\u7ae0\u8bb2\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002","title":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7ae0"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/#algorithm#to#judge#whether#two#string#has#substring#in#common","text":"Finding all the common substrings of given two strings Check if two strings have a common substring longest common substring problem suffix tree","title":"algorithm to judge whether two string has substring in common"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/#suffix#tree","text":"Ukkonen's suffix tree algorithm in plain English https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/suffix-tree?tab=Active","title":"suffix tree"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/#_2","text":"","title":"\u4f7f\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/#python","text":"def get_num_of_word_in_common ( word1 , word2 ): \"\"\"\u516c\u5171\u8bcd\u7684\u4e2a\u6570\"\"\" return len ( Counter ( word1 ) & Counter ( word2 ))","title":"\u4e00\u79cdpython\u5b9e\u73b0"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/LeetCode/LeetCode-14-%E6%9C%80%E9%95%BF%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%89%8D%E7%BC%80/","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/LeetCode/Reverse-%E5%8F%8D%E8%BD%AC/LeetCode-344-%E5%8F%8D%E8%BD%AC%E5%AD%97%E7%AC%A6%E4%B8%B2/","text":"leetcode 344. \u53cd\u8f6c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32 \u6211\u7684\u89e3\u7b54 #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std ; class Solution { public : void reverseString ( vector < char > & s ) { int left = 0 , right = s . size () - 1 ; while ( left < right ) { swap ( s [ left ], s [ right ]); left ++ ; right -- ; } } }; template < typename ...

Here are three articles that helped me solve the mystery as I learned. 1. Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm In computer science , the Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt string-searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm ) searches for occurrences of a \"word\" W within a main \"text string\" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters. The algorithm was conceived by James H. Morris and independently discovered by Donald Knuth \"a few weeks later\" from automata theory.[ 1] [ 2] Morris and Vaughan Pratt published a technical report in 1970.[ 3] The three also published the algorithm jointly in 1977.[ 1] Independently, in 1969, Matiyasevich [ 4] [ 5] discovered a similar algorithm, coded by a two-dimensional Turing machine, while studying a string-pattern-matching recognition problem over a binary alphabet. This was the first linear-time algorithm for string matching. 2. \u8be6\u89e3KMP\u7b97\u6cd5

The algorithm was conceived by James H. Morris and independently discovered by Donald Knuth \"a few weeks later\" from automata theory.[ 1] [ 2] Morris and Vaughan Pratt published a technical report in 1970.[ 3] The three also published the algorithm jointly in 1977.[ 1] Independently, in 1969, Matiyasevich [ 4] [ 5] discovered a similar algorithm, coded by a two-dimensional Turing machine, while studying a string-pattern-matching recognition problem over a binary alphabet. This was the first linear-time algorithm for string matching.","title":"1.

Following are some examples. txt[] = \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB\" pat[] = \"AAAAB\" txt[] = \"ABABABCABABABCABABABC\" pat[] = \"ABABAC\" (not a worst case, but a bad case for Naive) The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more than once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to O(n) . The basic idea behind KMP\u2019s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match. Let us consider below example to understand this. Matching Overview txt = \"AAAAABAAABA\" pat = \"AAAA\" We compare first window of txt with pat txt = \"AAAAABAAABA\" pat = \"AAAA\" [Initial position] We find a match. This is same as Naive String Matching. In the next step, we compare next window of txt with pat. txt = \"AAAAABAAABA\" pat = \"AAAA\" [Pattern shifted one position] This is where KMP does optimization over Naive. In this second window, we only compare fourth A of pattern with fourth character of current window of text to decide whether current window matches or not. Since we know first three characters will anyway match, we skipped matching first three characters. Need of Preprocessing? An important question arises from the above explanation, how to know how many characters to be skipped. To know this, we pre-process pattern and prepare an integer array lps[] that tells us the count of characters to be skipped. Preprocessing Overview: KMP algorithm preprocesses pat[] and constructs an auxiliary lps[] of size m (same as size of pattern) which is used to skip characters while matching. name lps indicates longest proper prefix which is also suffix. . A proper prefix is prefix with whole string not allowed. For example, prefixes of \u201cABC\u201d are \u201c\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cAB\u201d and \u201cABC\u201d. Proper prefixes are \u201c\u201d, \u201cA\u201d and \u201cAB\u201d. Suffixes of the string are \u201c\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cBC\u201d and \u201cABC\u201d. We search for lps in sub-patterns. More clearly we focus on sub-strings of patterns that are either prefix and suffix. For each sub-pattern pat[0..i] where i = 0 to m-1 , lps[i] stores length of the maximum matching proper prefix which is also a suffix of the sub-pattern pat[0..i] . lps[i] = the longest proper prefix of pat[0..i] which is also a suffix of pat[0..i]. Note : lps[i] could also be defined as longest prefix which is also proper suffix. We need to use properly at one place to make sure that the whole substring is not considered. Searching Algorithm: Unlike Naive algorithm , where we slide the pattern by one and compare all characters at each shift, we use a value from lps[] to decide the next characters to be matched. The idea is to not match a character that we know will anyway match. How to use lps[] to decide next positions (or to know a number of characters to be skipped)? We start comparison of pat[j] with j = 0 with characters of current window of text. We keep matching characters txt[i] and pat[j] and keep incrementing i and j while pat[j] and txt[i] keep matching . When we see a mismatch We know that characters pat[0..j-1] match with txt[i-j\u2026i-1] (Note that j starts with 0 and increment it only when there is a match). We also know (from above definition) that lps[j-1] is count of characters of pat[0\u2026j-1] that are both proper prefix and suffix. From above two points, we can conclude that we do not need to match these lps[j-1] characters with txt[i-j\u2026i-1] because we know that these characters will anyway match.

When we see a mismatch We know that characters pat[0..j-1] match with txt[i-j\u2026i-1] (Note that j starts with 0 and increment it only when there is a match). We also know (from above definition) that lps[j-1] is count of characters of pat[0\u2026j-1] that are both proper prefix and suffix. From above two points, we can conclude that we do not need to match these lps[j-1] characters with txt[i-j\u2026i-1] because we know that these characters will anyway match. Let us consider above example to understand this.","title":"Searching Algorithm:"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/String-search/Rabin-Karp-algorithm/","text":"Rabin\u2013Karp algorithm NOTE: \u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fdb\u884c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u79cd\u601d\u8def\uff1a hashing In computer science , the Rabin\u2013Karp algorithm or Karp\u2013Rabin algorithm is a string-searching algorithm created by Richard M.

The Rabin\u2013Karp algorithm instead achieves its speedup by using a hash function to quickly perform an approximate check for each position, and then only performing an exact comparison at the positions that pass this approximate check. A hash function is a function which converts every string into a numeric value, called its hash value ; for example, we might have hash(\"hello\")=5 . If two strings are equal, their hash values are also equal. For a well-designed hash function, the opposite is true, in an approximate sense: strings that are unequal are very unlikely to have equal hash values. The Rabin\u2013Karp algorithm proceeds by computing, at each position of the text, the hash value of a string starting at that position with the same length as the pattern. If this hash value equals the hash value of the pattern, it performs a full comparison at that position. The algorithm The algorithm is as shown: 1function RabinKarp(string s[1..n], string pattern[1..m]) 2 hpattern := hash(pattern[1..m]); 3 for i from 1 to n-m+1 4 hs := hash(s[i..i+m-1]) 5 if hs = hpattern 6 if s[i..i+m-1] = pattern[1..m] 7 return i 8 return not found Lines 2, 4, and 6 each require O ( m ) time. However, line 2 is only executed once, and line 6 is only executed if the hash values match, which is unlikely to happen more than a few times. Line 5 is executed O( n ) times, but each comparison only requires constant time, so its impact is O( n ). The issue is line 4. Naively computing the hash value for the substring s[i+1..i+m] requires O ( m ) time because each character is examined. Since the hash computation is done on each loop, the algorithm with a na\u00efve hash computation requires O (mn) time, the same complexity as a straightforward string matching algorithms. For speed, the hash must be computed in constant time. The trick is the variable hs already contains the previous hash value of s[i..i+m-1] . If that value can be used to compute the next hash value in constant time, then computing successive hash values will be fast. The trick can be exploited using a rolling hash . A rolling hash is a hash function specially designed to enable this operation. A trivial (but not very good) rolling hash function just adds the values of each character in the substring. This rolling hash formula can compute the next hash value from the previous value in constant time: s[i+1..i+m] = s[i..i+m-1] - s[i] + s[i+m] This simple function works, but will result in statement 5 being executed more often than other more sophisticated rolling hash functions such as those discussed in the next section.

The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a data structure similar to a trie with some additional links, and then constructs a finite state machine (automaton) in O(mk) O(mk) time, where k k is the size of the used alphabet. The algorithm was proposed by Alfred Aho and Margaret Corasick in 1975. Construction of the trie Formally a trie is a rooted tree, where each edge of the tree is labeled by some letter. All outgoing edge from one vertex mush have different labels. Consider any path in the trie from the root to any vertex. If we write out the labels of all edges on the path, we get a string that corresponds to this path. For any vertex in the trie we will associate the string from the root to the vertex. Each vertex will also have a flag leaf which will be true, if any string from the given set corresponds to this vertex. Accordingly to build a trie for a set of strings means to build a trie such that each leaf vertex will correspond to one string from the set, and conversely that each string of the set corresponds to one leaf vertex. We now describe how to construct a trie for a given set of strings in linear time with respect to their total length. We introduce a structure for the vertices of the tree. const int K = 26 ; struct Vertex { int next [ K ]; bool leaf = false ; Vertex () { fill ( begin ( next ), end ( next ), -1 ); } }; vector < Vertex > trie ( 1 ); Here we store the trie as an array of Vertex . Each Vertex contains the flag leaf , and the edges in the form of ans array next[] , where next[i] is the index to the vertex that we reach by following the character i , or \u22121, if there is no such edge. Initially the trie consists of only one vertex - the root - with the index 0. Now we implement a function that will add a string s to the trie. The implementation is extremely simple: we start at the root node, and as long as there are edges corresponding to the characters of s we follow them. If there is no edge for one character, we simply generate a new vertex and connect it via an edge. At the end of the process we mark the last vertex with flag leaf . void add_string ( string const & s ) { int v = 0 ; for ( char ch : s ) { int c = ch - 'a' ; if ( trie [ v ]. next [ c ] == -1 ) { trie [ v ]. next [ c ] = trie . size (); trie . emplace_back (); } v = trie [ v ]. next [ c ]; } trie [ v ]. leaf = true ; } The implementation obviously runs in linear time. And since every vertex store k links, it will use O(mk) memory. It is possible to decrease the memory consumption to O(m) by using a map instead of an array in each vertex. However this will increase the complexity to O(nlogk) . Construction of an automaton Suppose we have built a trie for the given set of strings. Now let's look at it from a different side. If we look at any vertex. The string that corresponds to it is a prefix of one or more strings in the set, thus each vertex of the trie can be interpreted as a position in one or more strings from the set. In fact the trie vertices can be interpreted as states in a finite deterministic automaton . From any state we can transition - using some input letter - to other states, i.e. to another position in the set of strings. For example, if there is only one string in the trie abc , and we are standing at vertex 2 (which corresponds to the string ab ), then using the letter c we can transition to the state 3 . Thus we can understand the edges of the trie as transitions in an automaton according to the corresponding letter. However for an automaton we cannot restrict the possible transitions for each state. If we try to perform a transition using a letter, and there is no corresponding edge in the trie, then we nevertheless must go into some state. Thus we can understand the edges of the trie as transitions in an automaton according to the corresponding letter. However for an automaton we cannot restrict the possible transitions for each state.

Aho and Margaret J. Corasick.[ 1] It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the \"dictionary\") within an input text. It matches all strings simultaneously. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in the length of the strings plus the length of the searched text plus the number of output matches. Note that because all matches are found, there can be a quadratic number of matches if every substring matches (e.g. dictionary = a , aa , aaa , aaaa and input string is aaaa ). Informally, the algorithm constructs a finite-state machine that resembles a trie with additional links between the various internal nodes. These extra internal links allow fast transitions between failed string matches (e.g. a search for cat in a trie that does not contain cat , but contains cart , and thus would fail at the node prefixed by ca ), to other branches of the trie that share a common prefix (e.g., in the previous case, a branch for attribute might be the best lateral transition). This allows the automaton to transition between string matches without the need for backtracking. When the string dictionary is known in advance (e.g. a computer virus database), the construction of the automaton can be performed once off-line and the compiled automaton stored for later use. In this case, its run time is linear in the length of the input plus the number of matched entries. The Aho\u2013Corasick string-matching algorithm formed the basis of the original Unix command fgrep . Example In this example, we will consider a dictionary consisting of the following words: { a , ab , bab , bc , bca , c , caa }. The graph below is the Aho\u2013Corasick data structure constructed from the specified dictionary, with each row in the table representing a node in the trie, with the column path indicating the (unique) sequence of characters from the root to the node. A visualization of the trie for the dictionary on the right. Suffix links are in blue; dictionary suffix links in green. Nodes corresponding to dictionary entries are highlighted in blue. The data structure has one node for every prefix of every string in the dictionary. So if ( bca ) is in the dictionary, then there will be nodes for ( bca ), ( bc ), ( b ), and (). If a node is in the dictionary then it is a blue node . Otherwise it is a grey node . There is a black directed \"child\" arc from each node to a node whose name is found by appending one character. So there is a black arc from ( bc ) to ( bca ). There is a blue directed \"suffix\" arc from each node to the node that is the longest possible strict suffix of it in the graph . For example, for node ( caa ), its strict suffixes are ( aa ) and ( a ) and (). The longest of these that exists in the graph is ( a ). So there is a blue arc from ( caa ) to ( a ). The blue arcs can be computed in linear time by repeatedly traversing the blue arcs of a node's parent until the traversing node has a child matching the character of the target node. There is a green \"dictionary suffix\" arc from each node to the next node in the dictionary that can be reached by following blue arcs . For example, there is a green arc from ( bca ) to ( a ) because ( a ) is the first node in the dictionary (i.e. a blue node) that is reached when following the blue arcs to ( ca ) and then on to (a). The green arcs can be computed in linear time by repeatedly traversing blue arcs until a filled in node is found, and memoizing this information.

When the algorithm reaches a node, it outputs all the dictionary entries that end at the current character position in the input text. This is done by printing every node reached by following the dictionary suffix links, starting from that node, and continuing until it reaches a node with no dictionary suffix link. In addition, the node itself is printed, if it is a dictionary entry.

Aho and Margaret J. Corasick.[ 1] It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the \"dictionary\") within an input text. It matches all strings simultaneously. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in the length of the strings plus the length of the searched text plus the number of output matches. Note that because all matches are found, there can be a quadratic number of matches if every substring matches (e.g. dictionary = a , aa , aaa , aaaa and input string is aaaa ). Informally, the algorithm constructs a finite-state machine that resembles a trie with additional links between the various internal nodes. These extra internal links allow fast transitions between failed string matches (e.g. a search for cat in a trie that does not contain cat , but contains cart , and thus would fail at the node prefixed by ca ), to other branches of the trie that share a common prefix (e.g., in the previous case, a branch for attribute might be the best lateral transition). This allows the automaton to transition between string matches without the need for backtracking. When the string dictionary is known in advance (e.g. a computer virus database), the construction of the automaton can be performed once off-line and the compiled automaton stored for later use. In this case, its run time is linear in the length of the input plus the number of matched entries. The Aho\u2013Corasick string-matching algorithm formed the basis of the original Unix command fgrep .","title":"Aho\u2013Corasick algorithm"},{"location":"Data-structure/String/String-search/TODO-Aho-Corasick-algorithm/wikipedia-Aho-Corasick-algorithm/#example","text":"In this example, we will consider a dictionary consisting of the following words: { a , ab , bab , bc , bca , c , caa }.

If search time were unbounded, a very compact unordered linear list would be the best medium; if storage space were unbounded, a randomly accessible structure indexable by the key value would be very large, very sparse, but very fast. A hash function takes a finite amount of time to map a potentially large key space to a feasible amount of storage space searchable in a bounded amount of time regardless of the number of keys.

If search time were unbounded, a very compact unordered linear list would be the best medium; if storage space were unbounded, a randomly accessible structure indexable by the key value would be very large, very sparse, but very fast. A hash function takes a finite amount of time to map a potentially large key space to a feasible amount of storage space searchable in a bounded amount of time regardless of the number of keys.

\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u5982\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1a Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search : when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables . B tree VS hash table cstack.github Introduction to the B-Tree Why is a tree a good data structure for a database? Searching for a particular value is fast (logarithmic time) Inserting / deleting a value you\u2019ve already found is fast (constant-ish time to rebalance) Traversing a range of values is fast (unlike a hash map) Self-balancing binary search tree VS hash table wikipedia Self-balancing binary search tree Self-balancing binary search trees can be used in a natural way to construct and maintain ordered lists, such as priority queues . They can also be used for associative arrays ; key-value pairs are simply inserted with an ordering based on the key alone. In this capacity, self-balancing BSTs have a number of advantages and disadvantages over their main competitor, hash tables . One advantage of self-balancing BSTs is that they allow fast (indeed, asymptotically optimal) enumeration of the items in key order , which hash tables do not provide. One disadvantage is that their lookup algorithms get more complicated when there may be multiple items with the same key. Self-balancing BSTs have better worst-case lookup performance than hash tables (O(log n) compared to O(n)), but have worse average-case performance (O(log n) compared to O(1)). stackoverflow Skip List vs. Binary Search Tree I recently came across the data structure known as a skip list . It seems to have very similar behavior to a binary search tree. Why would you ever want to use a skip list over a binary search tree? A Skip lists are more amenable to concurrent access/modification. Herb Sutter wrote an article about data structure in concurrent environments. It has more indepth information. The most frequently used implementation of a binary search tree is a red-black tree . The concurrent problems come in when the tree is modified it often needs to rebalance. The rebalance operation can affect large portions of the tree, which would require a mutex lock on many of the tree nodes. Inserting a node into a skip list is far more localized, only nodes directly linked to the affected node need to be locked. Update from Jon Harrops comments I read Fraser and Harris's latest paper Concurrent programming without locks . Really good stuff if you're interested in lock-free data structures. The paper focuses on Transactional Memory and a theoretical operation multiword-compare-and-swap MCAS. Both of these are simulated in software as no hardware supports them yet. I'm fairly impressed that they were able to build MCAS in software at all. I didn't find the transactional memory stuff particularly compelling as it requires a garbage collector. Also software transactional memory is plagued with performance issues. However, I'd be very excited if hardware transactional memory ever becomes common. In the end it's still research and won't be of use for production code for another decade or so. In section 8.2 they compare the performance of several concurrent tree implementations. I'll summarize their findings. It's worth it to download the pdf as it has some very informative graphs on pages 50, 53, and 54. 1\u3001 Locking skip lists are insanely fast. They scale incredibly well with the number of concurrent accesses. This is what makes skip lists special, other lock based data structures tend to croak under pressure. 2\u3001 Lock-free skip lists are consistently faster than locking skip lists but only barely. 3\u3001 transactional skip lists are consistently 2-3 times slower than the locking and non-locking versions. 4\u3001 locking red-black trees croak under concurrent access. Their performance degrades linearly with each new concurrent user. Of the two known locking red-black tree implementations, one essentially has a global lock during tree rebalancing. The other uses fancy (and complicated) lock escalation but still doesn't significantly out perform the global lock version. 5\u3001 lock-free red-black trees don't exist (no longer true, see Update). 6\u3001 transactional red-black trees are comparable with transactional skip-lists. That was very surprising and very promising. Transactional memory, though slower if far easier to write. It can be as easy as quick search and replace on the non-concurrent version. Update Here is paper about lock-free trees: Lock-Free Red-Black Trees Using CAS . I haven't looked into it deeply, but on the surface it seems solid. COMMENTS : Not to mention that in a non-degenerate(\u9000\u5316) skiplist, about 50% of the nodes should only have a single link which makes insert and delete remarkably efficient. \u2013 Adisak Oct 30 '09 at 3:44 Rebalancing does not require a mutex lock.

Fraser and Harris show how a transactional memory based red-black tree is implemented and its performance. Transactional memory is still very much in the research arena, so in production code, a red-black tree will still need to lock large portions of the tree. \u2013 deft_code May 21 '10 at 16:20 I wanted to update this answer.

Simple genius! \u2013 user82238 Jun 19 '12 at 10:29 @BlankXavier , Hmmm, that sounds suspiciously like using a spinlock instead of a mutex for a regular lock based tree.

merge\u2013find set , is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union ), and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two elements are in the same or different sets. Disjoint-set data structures play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The importance of minimum spanning trees means that disjoint-set data structures underlie a wide variety of algorithms. In addition, disjoint-set data structures also have applications to symbolic computation, as well in compilers, especially for register allocation problems. Applications Disjoint-set data structures model the partitioning of a set , for example to keep track of the connected components of an undirected graph . This model can then be used to determine whether two vertices belong to the same component, or whether adding an edge between them would result in a cycle. The Union\u2013Find algorithm is used in high-performance implementations of unification .[ 15] This data structure is used by the Boost Graph Library to implement its Incremental Connected Components functionality.

Understand parentheses and you can rule the earth. No, seriously! Parentheses, trees and stacks are all interconnected in a very deep and fundamental way. Back in the early days of programming, long before Google started asking why manhole covers are round, one of the very common programming aptitude tests was to take a long mess of parentheses and ask the candidate if they were valid. Something like: Is: (((((()))((()))))))((())))))) a valid expression? So parentheses are fundamental to programming and being able to handle parentheses is a fundamental programming skill. But why? The simple reason why the humble parenthesis is so great is that it forms a tree structure as soon as you give it a chance. Hence the title - Parentheses Are Trees. The fact that parentheses are trees might not seem obvious so let's see how this works. A single parenthesis is a useless thing. It only comes into its own when paired with a parenthesis of the opposite handedness. The reason that a ( goes with a ) is simply that together they form a container . Put simply you can put something in between the parenthesis - (data) Usually the data that you put in the parenthesis has some sort of structure but this isn't really relevant to the key property of parenthesis. However even at this stage you can see that parenthesis can be used to represent an array: (first) (second) (third) (fourth) What makes parenthesis really useful is that the data that you place between a pair of parenthesis can be another pair of parenthesis. This is always the moment when a simple data structure turns into a complex one - let a one dimensional array element store another array and the result is a two dimensional and more array. Letting a data structure store other data structures is one way of getting brand new things. If you allow a parenthesis pair to store another pair of parenthesis then the result is a tree. For example: (()()) corresponds to a binary tree with two terminal nodes: | /\\ (()()) You can now construct examples as complicated as you care to make them. For example: | / \\ /\\ \\ / \\ \\ / \\ \\ /\\ /\\ \\ (((()())(()()))()) The nesting of parenthesis simply gives the structure of the tree that the parenthesis correspond to. Now you can see why many computer languages use a lot of parenthesis. Probably none more so than the infamous Lisp and at this point who could resist quoting the well known xkcd cartoon: For more xkcd cartoons click here . Lisp can get away with adding very little additional machinery to the parenthesis to create a complete and powerful language. The fact that parenthesis form a tree structure also explains the strange and arbitrary rules that you had to learn in school concerning arithmetic. The rule of arithmetic expressions form a \"little\" language the grammar of which can be expressed as a very simple tree structure with the rule that you always work out the expression by doing a left to right depth first walk. Consider the expression 3+2*5. To make sense of this and evaluate it correctly we have to invoke the idea of operator precedence. In particular we have to say that multiply has a higher precedence than addition so that the expression is 2 times 5 plus 3. However if this expression had been written as ((3)+((2)*(5))) then no operator precedence rules need to be used. The parenthesised expression corresponds to the tree: + / \\ / * / / \\ ((3)+((2)*(5))) NOTE: binary expression tree can also be used to demostrate the relavance between tree and parenthesis. and you can see that walking the tree in depth first either right to left or left to right and performing the operations indicated at each of the nodes gives you the correct evaluation. Here is a depth first left-to-right evaluation: In other words if you are prepared to put all the parenthesis needed into the expression to make the syntax tree of the expression clear and unambiguous you don't need to introduce the idea of operator precedence. Of course we prefer to leave out parenthesis and complicate things by claiming that multiplication has to be done before addition. In fact we leave out so many parenthesis that we have to use the \"My Dear Aunt Sally\" rule - i.e. Multiplication and Division before Addition and Subtraction. Perhaps the biggest use of parenthesis today is in the form of all those markup languages that generate hierarchies i.e. trees of visual objects. For example what is HTML other than a bracketing syntax - <open tab>content</close tag> Just think of each open tag as a \"(\" and each closing tag as a \")\". The same is true of XAML and all the other object instantiation languages. They all create tree structures. In a more general context XML is a bracketing system that generates general tree structures consisting of arbitrary data. For another example consider the nesting of control structures such as for , if , do while and so on. These too are a bracketing language, often using curly brackets {} , and they generate a tree structure which the compiler has to work out to successfully parse the language. Once you notice the way bracketing generates hierarchies and general tree structures you start noticing them more or less everywhere. Perhaps now you will agree that parenthesis are fundamental to programming and testing the ability to work with them is probably a good way to see if some one is going to make the grade as a programmer. We have one question remaining - what arrangements of parenthesis are legal? The simple answer is only those arrangements that correspond to complete tree structures and there are only two ways in which a set of parenthesis can fail to do so. The first is just not having the same number of opening and closing parenthesis. You can't have half a container and so all valid bracketing structures have to match numbers of opening and closing parenthesis. This is a minimal condition for legal parenthesis. The second condition is that the pairs of parenthesis always occur in the right order - that is you always have () and never )(. Put as simply as this you would think that this condition is trivial but it is very easy to hide a pair of parenthesis in the wrong order. For example, ())(()() This structure is clearly wrong but there is no single answer to exactly what is wrong with it. For example you might say that it corresponds to any of the following groupings: () )( ()() () )( ( )( ) ( ))(()( ) In other words there is no single correct way to parse an incorrect structure. So how do we check for a valid bracketing structure? There is more than one answer to this but the simplest is to see if it is possible to walk the tree that the parenthesis describe. To do this you need a stack . All you have to do is scan the expression from left-to-right. Each time you encounter an opening parenthesis push it on the stack. Each time you encounter a closing parenthesis pop the top of the stack - if there is nothing on the top of the stack to pop then you have an invalid set of parenthesis. If you reach the end of the scan without trying to pop an empty stack then the stack will be empty if the expression was valid. For example in the case of: ((()())) the stack contents are: stack remainder 0 . ((()())). 1 .( (()())). 2 .(( ()())). 3 .((( )())). 4 .(( ())). 5 .((( ))). 6 .(( )). 7 .( ). 8 . . As the stack is empty when the scan is complete the expression was valid. The real question is can you see that this algorithm works? The answer is that the stack algorithm performs a depth-first left-to-right tree walk and this can only be completed if the parenthesis really do specify a tree. Notice that we are only considering parenthesis that are unlabeled - that is any closing parenthesis will pair with any opening parenthesis . Things become a little more difficult if you allow named parenthesis as in HTML, XML or program language structures. Then there are other ways to get things wrong such as <div><span></div></span> . You can easily modify the stack algorithm to detect such errors - all you have to do is make sure that the popped parenthesis matches the closing parenthesis that caused the pop operation. Parenthesis , stacks and trees go together perfectly. The final word however should go to xkcd and the observation in its blog of a halcyon time when Wikipedia had a sense of humor. The blog quotes from the Wikipedia article on parenthesis: Parentheses may also be nested (with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing [though sometimes other brackets (especially parentheses) will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses (in other words, secondary {or even tertiary } phrases can be found within the main sentence)] Sadly the Wikipedia entry no longer contains this paragraph...

In order for a tree to function as a search tree, the key for each node must be greater than any keys in subtrees on the left, and less than any keys in subtrees on the right.[ 1] The advantage of search trees is that their efficient search time given the tree is reasonably balanced, which is to say the leaves at either end are of comparable depths. Various search-tree data structures exist, several of which also allow efficient insertion and deletion of elements, which operations then have to maintain tree balance. Search trees are often used to implement an associative array . The search tree algorithm uses the key from the key-value pair to find a location, and then the application stores the entire key\u2013value pair at that particular location. Types of Trees Binary Search Tree Main article: Binary search tree A Binary Search Tree is a node-based data structure where each node contains a key and two subtrees, the left and right. For all nodes, the left subtree's key must be less than the node's key, and the right subtree's key must be greater than the node's key. These subtrees must all qualify as binary search trees. The worst-case time complexity for searching a binary search tree is the height of the tree , which can be as small as O(log n) for a tree with n elements. B-tree Main article: B-tree B-trees are generalizations of binary search trees in that they can have a variable number of subtrees at each node. While child-nodes have a pre-defined range, they will not necessarily be filled with data, meaning B-trees can potentially waste some space. The advantage is that B-trees do not need to be re-balanced as frequently as other self-balancing trees . Due to the variable range of their node length, B-trees are optimized for systems that read large blocks of data, they are also commonly used in databases. The time complexity for searching a B-tree is O(log n). (a,b)-tree Main article: (a,b)-tree An (a,b)-tree is a search tree where all of its leaves are the same depth. Each node has at least a children and at most b children, while the root has at least 2 children and at most b children. a and b can be decided with the following formula:[ 2] {\\displaystyle 2\\leq a\\leq {\\frac {(b+1)}{2}}} The time complexity for searching an (a,b)-tree is O(log n). Ternary search tree Main article: Ternary search tree A ternary search tree is a type of tree that can have 3 nodes: a lo kid, an equal kid, and a hi kid. Each node stores a single character and the tree itself is ordered the same way a binary search tree is, with the exception of a possible third node. Searching a ternary search tree involves passing in a string to test whether any path contains it. The time complexity for searching a balanced ternary search tree is O(log n). Searching Algorithms Searching for a Specific Key Assuming the tree is ordered, we can take a key and attempt to locate it within the tree. The following algorithms are generalized for binary search trees, but the same idea can be applied to trees of other formats.

The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.[ 1] Unlike other self-balancing binary search trees , the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs\uff08\u78c1\u76d8\uff09. It is commonly used in databases and file systems . What, if anything, the B stands for has never been established. Overview In B-trees, internal ( non-leaf ) nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within some pre-defined range. When data is inserted or removed from a node, its number of child nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre-defined range, internal nodes may be joined or split . Because a range of child nodes is permitted, B-trees do not need re-balancing as frequently as other self-balancing search trees , but may waste some space, since nodes are not entirely full. The lower and upper bounds on the number of child nodes are typically fixed for a particular implementation. For example, in a 2-3 B-tree (often simply referred to as a 2-3 tree ), each internal node may have only 2 or 3 child nodes. NOTE: : \u6309\u7167\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u547d\u540d\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\uff0c 2-3 B-tree \u7684\u53c2\u6570\u662f 1 + 1\uff0c 2 * 1 + 1 \uff0c\u5373 2-3 B-tree \u7684 d =1\uff1b Each internal node of a B-tree contains a number of keys . The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees . For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: *a*1 and *a*2. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than *a*1, all values in the middle subtree will be between *a*1 and *a*2, and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than *a*2. Usually, the number of keys is chosen to vary between $ d $ and $ 2d $, where $ d $ is the minimum number of keys, and $ d+1 $ is the minimum degree or branching factor of the tree\uff08 d \u4e2a\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6570\u8f74\u5206\u4e3a d+1 \u6bb5\uff09. In practice, the keys take up the most space in a node. The factor of 2 will guarantee that nodes can be split or combined\uff08\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684 2 \u6240\u6307\u4e3a\u524d\u9762\u7684 2d \uff09. If an internal node has $ 2d $ keys, then adding a key to that node can be accomplished by splitting the hypothetical $ 2d+1 $ key node into two $ d $ key nodes and moving the key that would have been in the middle to the parent node. Each split node has the required minimum number of keys. Similarly, if an internal node and its neighbor each have $ d $ keys, then a key may be deleted from the internal node by combining it with its neighbor. Deleting the key would make the internal node have $ d-1 $ keys; joining the neighbor would add $ d $ keys plus one more key brought down from the neighbor's parent. The result is an entirely full node of $ 2d $ keys.

In a 2-3 B-tree, the internal nodes will store either one key (with two child nodes) or two keys (with three child nodes). A B-tree is sometimes described with the parameters $ (d+1) $ \u2014 $ (2d+1) $ or simply with the highest branching order, $ (2d+1) $. Variants The term B-tree may refer to a specific design or it may refer to a general class of designs. In the narrow sense, a B-tree stores keys in its internal nodes but need not store those keys in the records at the leaves. The general class includes variations such as the B+ tree and the B* tree. 1\u3001In the B+ tree , copies of the keys are stored in the internal nodes; the keys and records are stored in leaves; in addition, a leaf node may include a pointer to the next leaf node to speed sequential access .[ 1] 2\u3001The B* tree balances more neighboring internal nodes to keep the internal nodes more densely packed. [1] 3\u3001B-trees can be turned into order statistic trees to allow rapid searches for the Nth record in key order, or counting the number of records between any two records, and various other related operations.[ 3] B-tree usage in databases Time to search a sorted file Usually, sorting and searching algorithms have been characterized by the number of comparison operations that must be performed using order notation . A binary search of a sorted table with N records, for example, can be done in roughly \u2308 log2 N \u2309 comparisons. If the table had 1,000,000 records, then a specific record could be located with at most 20 comparisons: \u2308 log2 (1,000,000) \u2309 = 20. An index speeds the search A significant improvement can be made with an index . In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index ). This auxiliary index would be 1% of the size of the original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database\u2014at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last six or so comparisons in the auxiliary index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about eight disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads. Insertions and deletions Advantages of B-tree usage for databases The B-tree uses all of the ideas described above. In particular, a B-tree: 1\u3001keeps keys in sorted order for sequential traversing 2\u3001uses a hierarchical index to minimize the number of disk reads 3\u3001uses partially full blocks to speed insertions and deletions 4\u3001keeps the index balanced with a recursive algorithm In addition, a B-tree minimizes waste by making sure the interior nodes are at least half full. A B-tree can handle an arbitrary number of insertions and deletions. Technical description Definition According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order m is a tree which satisfies the following properties: Every node has at most m children. Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least \u2308 m /2\u2309 child nodes. The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node. A non-leaf node with k children contains k \u2212 1 keys. All leaves appear in the same level and carry no information. Each internal node\u2019s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: *a*1 and *a*2.

The B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.[ 1] Unlike other self-balancing binary search trees , the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as discs\uff08\u78c1\u76d8\uff09.

When data is inserted or removed from a node, its number of child nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre-defined range, internal nodes may be joined or split . Because a range of child nodes is permitted, B-trees do not need re-balancing as frequently as other self-balancing search trees , but may waste some space, since nodes are not entirely full. The lower and upper bounds on the number of child nodes are typically fixed for a particular implementation. For example, in a 2-3 B-tree (often simply referred to as a 2-3 tree ), each internal node may have only 2 or 3 child nodes.

The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees . For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: *a*1 and *a*2. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than *a*1, all values in the middle subtree will be between *a*1 and *a*2, and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than *a*2. Usually, the number of keys is chosen to vary between $ d $ and $ 2d $, where $ d $ is the minimum number of keys, and $ d+1 $ is the minimum degree or branching factor of the tree\uff08 d \u4e2a\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6570\u8f74\u5206\u4e3a d+1 \u6bb5\uff09. In practice, the keys take up the most space in a node. The factor of 2 will guarantee that nodes can be split or combined\uff08\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684 2 \u6240\u6307\u4e3a\u524d\u9762\u7684 2d \uff09. If an internal node has $ 2d $ keys, then adding a key to that node can be accomplished by splitting the hypothetical $ 2d+1 $ key node into two $ d $ key nodes and moving the key that would have been in the middle to the parent node. Each split node has the required minimum number of keys. Similarly, if an internal node and its neighbor each have $ d $ keys, then a key may be deleted from the internal node by combining it with its neighbor. Deleting the key would make the internal node have $ d-1 $ keys; joining the neighbor would add $ d $ keys plus one more key brought down from the neighbor's parent. The result is an entirely full node of $ 2d $ keys.

They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name). Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search : when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.

They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name). Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search : when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.

The same algorithms can be adapted to serve similar functions on ordered lists of any construct, e.g. permutations on a list of digits or shapes. In particular, a bitwise trie is keyed on the individual bits making up any fixed-length binary datum, such as an integer or memory address. A trie for keys \"A\", \"to\", \"tea\", \"ted\", \"ten\", \"i\", \"in\", and \"inn\". Note that this example does not have all the children alphabetically sorted from left to right as it should be (the root and node 't'). Applications As a replacement for other data structures As discussed below, a trie has a number of advantages over binary search trees. A trie can also be used to replace a hash table , over which it has the following advantages: Looking up data in a trie is faster in the worst case, O(m) time (where m is the length of a search string), compared to an imperfect hash table. An imperfect hash table can have key collisions. A key collision is the hash function mapping of different keys to the same position in a hash table. The worst-case lookup speed in an imperfect hash table is O(N) time, but far more typically is O(1), with O(m) time spent evaluating the hash. There are no collisions of different keys in a trie. Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated with more than one value. There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie. A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key. However, a trie also has some drawbacks compared to a hash table: Trie lookup can be slower than hash table lookup, especially if the data is directly accessed on a hard disk drive or some other secondary storage device where the random-access time is high compared to main memory.[ 7] Some keys, such as floating point numbers, can lead to long chains and prefixes that are not particularly meaningful. Nevertheless, a bitwise trie can handle standard IEEE single and double format floating point numbers.[ citation needed ] Some tries can require more space than a hash table, as memory may be allocated for each character in the search string, rather than a single chunk of memory for the whole entry, as in most hash tables. Dictionary representation A common application of a trie is storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary, such as found on a mobile telephone . Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries; however, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e., storage of information auxiliary to each word is not required), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) would use less space than a trie. This is because a DAFSA can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored. Tries are also well suited for implementing approximate matching algorithms,[ 8] including those used in spell checking and hyphenation [ 4] software. Term indexing A discrimination tree term index stores its information in a trie data structure.[ 9] Algorithms The trie is a tree of nodes which supports Find and Insert operations. Find returns the value for a key string, and Insert inserts a string (the key) and a value into the trie. Both Insert and Find run in O( n ) time, where n is the length of the key. A simple Node class can be used to represent nodes in the trie: class Node (): def __init__ ( self ): # Note that using dictionary for children (as in this implementation) would not allow lexicographic sorting mentioned in the next section (Sorting), # because ordinary dictionary would not preserve the order of the keys self . children : Dict [ str , Node ] = {} # mapping from character ==> Node self . value : Any = None Note that children is a dictionary of characters to a node's children; and it is said that a \"terminal\" node is one which represents a complete string. A trie's value can be looked up as follows: def find ( node : Node , key : str ) -> Any : for char in key : if char in node . children : node = node . children [ char ] else : return None return node . value Insertion proceeds by walking the trie according to the string to be inserted, then appending new nodes for the suffix of the string that is not contained in the trie: def insert ( node : Node , key : str , value : Any ) -> None : for char in key : if char not in node . children : node . children [ char ] = Node () node = node . children [ char ] node . value = value Sorting Lexicographic sorting of a set of keys can be accomplished by building a trie from them, and traversing it in pre-order , printing only the leaves' values. This algorithm is a form of radix sort .[ 10] A trie forms the fundamental data structure of Burstsort , which (in 2007) was the fastest known string sorting algorithm.[ 11] However, now there are faster string sorting algorithms.[ 12] Full text search A special kind of trie, called a suffix tree , can be used to index all suffixes in a text in order to carry out fast full text searches.

A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the \"children\"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root. NOTE: \u4e0a\u8ff0\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u662f Recursive definition \u3002 Alternatively, a tree can be defined abstractly as a whole (globally) as an ordered tree , with a value assigned to each node. Both these perspectives are useful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole, when actually represented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with separately by node (rather than as a set of nodes and an adjacency list of edges between nodes, as one may represent a digraph , for instance). For example, looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about \"the parent node\" of a given node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any). Preliminary definition A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

In most cases, there is also an additional \"horizontal\" ordering between siblings. In search trees the order is commonly established by the \"key\" or value associated with each sibling, but in many trees that is not the case. For example, XML documents, lists within JSON files, and many other structures have order that does not depend on the values in the nodes, but is itself data \u2014 sorting the paragraphs of a novel alphabetically would lose information.

Indeed, a binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists (a list where the values are lists): the head of a list (the value of the first term) is the left child (subtree), while the tail (the list of second and subsequent terms) is the right child (subtree). This can be modified to allow values as well, as in Lisp S-expressions , where the head (value of first term) is the value of the node, the head of the tail (value of second term) is the left child, and the tail of the tail (list of third and subsequent terms) is the right child. NOTE: In general a node in a tree will not have pointers to its parents, but this information can be included (expanding the data structure to also include a pointer to the parent) or stored separately. Alternatively, upward links can be included in the child node data, as in a threaded binary tree .

Both these perspectives are useful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole, when actually represented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with separately by node (rather than as a set of nodes and an adjacency list of edges between nodes, as one may represent a digraph , for instance). For example, looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about \"the parent node\" of a given node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any).","title":"wikipedia Tree (data structure)"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-data-structure/#preliminary#definition","text":"A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.

Some use the definition commonly used in computer science,[ 7] but others define it as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either.[ 8]","title":"wikipedia Binary tree"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/","text":"TODO","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/Build-tree/","text":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7ae0 \u672c\u7ae0\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u9020tree\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u8def\uff1a \u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\uff08reduce\uff09 \u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\uff08expand\uff09 \u7406\u89e3\u6811\u6784\u9020\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6848\u4f8b\u5c31\u662fparsing\uff0c\u5728parsing\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6709\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u548c\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002 \u5173\u4e8eparsing\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53c2\u89c1\uff1a \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 Parsing \u5de5\u7a0b compiler-principle \u7684 Chapter-4-Syntax-Analysis \u6811\u6784\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5730\u65b9\u90fd\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8fd0\u7528\u3002 TODO: \u7ed3\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\uff1a \u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a \u751f\u6210nav tree \u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a shift-reduce parsing","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/Build-tree/#_1","text":"\u672c\u7ae0\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u9020tree\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u8def\uff1a \u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\uff08reduce\uff09 \u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\uff08expand\uff09 \u7406\u89e3\u6811\u6784\u9020\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6848\u4f8b\u5c31\u662fparsing\uff0c\u5728parsing\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6709\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u548c\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002 \u5173\u4e8eparsing\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53c2\u89c1\uff1a \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 Parsing \u5de5\u7a0b compiler-principle \u7684 Chapter-4-Syntax-Analysis \u6811\u6784\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5730\u65b9\u90fd\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8fd0\u7528\u3002 TODO: \u7ed3\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\uff1a \u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a \u751f\u6210nav tree \u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\uff1a shift-reduce parsing","title":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7ae0"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/Rank-of-node/","text":"Rank \u79e9 \u5728 labuladong \u554a\u8fd9\uff0c\u4e00\u9053\u627e\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9898\u628a\u4e1c\u54e5\u6574\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4e86\u2026 \u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u53ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898: PS\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u8ba9\u4f60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u4e8c\u53c9\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u540d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e94\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 rank(int index) \uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u600e\u4e48\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1f\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u601d\u8003\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u628a\u7b54\u6848\u5199\u5728\u7559\u8a00\u533a\u7f6e\u9876\u3002 TODO 1\u3001stackexchange Rank of root in AVL tree 2\u3001stackoverflow Rank of a node in a order-statistics tree 3\u3001stackoverflow Computing rank of a node in a binary search tree","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/Rank-of-node/#rank","text":"\u5728 labuladong \u554a\u8fd9\uff0c\u4e00\u9053\u627e\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9898\u628a\u4e1c\u54e5\u6574\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4e86\u2026 \u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u53ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898: PS\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u8ba9\u4f60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u4e8c\u53c9\u641c\u7d22\u6811\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u540d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e94\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 rank(int index) \uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u600e\u4e48\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1f\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u601d\u8003\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u628a\u7b54\u6848\u5199\u5728\u7559\u8a00\u533a\u7f6e\u9876\u3002","title":"Rank \u79e9"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/Rank-of-node/#todo","text":"1\u3001stackexchange Rank of root in AVL tree 2\u3001stackoverflow Rank of a node in a order-statistics tree 3\u3001stackoverflow Computing rank of a node in a binary search tree","title":"TODO"},{"location":"Data-structure/Tree/Tree-operation/Traversal/","text":"wikipedia Tree traversal In computer science , tree traversal (also known as tree search ) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure , exactly once.

Because from a given node there is more than one possible next node (it is not a linear data structure), then, assuming sequential computation (not parallel), some nodes must be deferred \u2014stored in some way for later visiting. This is often done via a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). As a tree is a self-referential (recursively defined) data structure, traversal can be defined by recursion or, more subtly(\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684), corecursion , in a very natural and clear fashion; in these cases the deferred nodes are stored implicitly in the call stack .

For a binary tree, they are defined as display operations recursively at each node, starting with the root, whose algorithm is as follows:[ 2] [ 3] The general recursive pattern for traversing a (non-empty) binary tree is this: At node N do the following: (L) Recursively traverse its left subtree. This step is finished at the node N again. (R) Recursively traverse its right subtree. This step is finished at the node N again. (N) Process N itself. These steps can be done in any order . If (L) is done before (R), the process is called left-to-right traversal, otherwise it is called right-to-left traversal.

Perform in-order operation. 3\u3001Perform post-order operation. Depending on the problem at hand, the pre-order, in-order or post-order operations may be void, or you may only want to visit a specific child, so these operations are optional. Also, in practice more than one of pre-order, in-order and post-order operations may be required. For example, when inserting into a ternary tree , a pre-order operation is performed by comparing items. A post-order operation may be needed afterwards to re-balance the tree. Breadth-first search / level order Main article: Breadth-first search Trees can also be traversed in level-order , where we visit every node on a level before going to a lower level. This search is referred to as breadth-first search (BFS), as the search tree is broadened as much as possible on each depth before going to the next depth. Other types There are also tree traversal algorithms that classify as neither depth-first search nor breadth-first search. One such algorithm is Monte Carlo tree search , which concentrates on analyzing the most promising moves, basing the expansion of the search tree on random sampling of the search space. Applications Pre-order traversal Prefix expression Pre-order traversal can be used to make a prefix expression ( Polish notation ) from expression trees : traverse the expression tree pre-orderly. For example, traversing the depicted arithmetic expression in pre-order yields \" + * 1 - 2 3 + 4 5 \". In-order traversal Binary-search tree In-order traversal is very commonly used on binary search trees because it returns values from the underlying set in order, according to the comparator that set up the binary search tree (hence the name). Post-order traversal Delete or free entire binary tree Post-order traversal while deleting or freeing nodes and values can delete or free an entire binary tree. Thereby the node is freed after freeing its children.

IterativePostorderTraversal (); return 0 ; } // g++ test.cpp All the above implementations require stack space proportional to the height of the tree which is a call stack for the recursive and a parent stack for the iterative ones. In a poorly balanced tree, this can be considerable. With the iterative implementations we can remove the stack requirement by maintaining parent pointers in each node, or by threading the tree (next section). Morris in-order traversal using threading NOTE: 1\u3001\u8fd9\u4e00\u6bb5\u6ca1\u6709\u8bfb\u61c2 A binary tree is threaded by making every left child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order predecessor of the node (if it exists) and every right child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order successor of the node (if it exists). Advantages: Avoids recursion, which uses a call stack and consumes memory and time. The node keeps a record of its parent. Disadvantages: The tree is more complex. We can make only one traversal at a time. It is more prone to errors when both the children are not present and both values of nodes point to their ancestors. Morris traversal is an implementation of in-order traversal that uses threading:[ 6] Create links to the in-order successor. Print the data using these links. Revert the changes to restore original tree. Breadth-first search Also, listed below is pseudocode for a simple queue based level-order traversal, and will require space proportional to the maximum number of nodes at a given depth.

Advantages: Avoids recursion, which uses a call stack and consumes memory and time. The node keeps a record of its parent. Disadvantages: The tree is more complex. We can make only one traversal at a time. It is more prone to errors when both the children are not present and both values of nodes point to their ancestors.

The discussion of enumeration in this book begins with the basic techniques of counting .

These discrete structures include sets , permutations , relations , graphs , trees , and finite-state machines . Algorithmic Thinking Certain classes of problems are solved by the specification of an algorithm. After an algorithm has been described, a computer program can be constructed implementing it. The mathematical portions of this activity, which include the specification of the algorithm, the verification that it works properly, and the analysis of the computer memory and time required to perform it,are all covered in this text.

There are many applications to computer science and data networking in this text, as well as applications to such diverse areas as chemistry, biology, linguistics, geography, business, and the Internet. These applications are natural and important uses of discrete mathematics and are not contrived.

Modeling with discrete mathematics is an extremely important problem-solving skill, which students have the opportunity to develop by constructing their own models in some of the exercises.","title":"Applications and Modeling"},{"location":"Discrete-math/Book-Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications/","text":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7ae0 \u672c\u7ae0\u662f\u6211\u9605\u8bfb Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications \u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u3002","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Discrete-math/Book-Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications/#_1","text":"\u672c\u7ae0\u662f\u6211\u9605\u8bfb Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications \u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u3002","title":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7ae0"},{"location":"Discrete-math/Book-Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications/Chapter-2-Basic-Structures/","text":"2 Basic Structures: Sets, Functions, Sequences, Sums, and Matrices Much of discrete mathematics is devoted to the study of discrete structures, used to represent discrete objects .

This subject was studied as long ago as the seventeenth century, when combinatorial questions arose in the study of gambling games. Enumeration, the counting of objects with certain properties, is an important part of combinatorics. We must count objects to solve many different types of problems. For instance, counting is used to determine the complexity of algorithms. Counting is also required to determine whether there are enough telephone numbers or Internet protocol addresses to meet demand. Recently,it has played a key role in mathematical biology, especially in sequencing DNA. Furthermore, counting techniques are used extensively when probabilities of events are computed. 6.1 The Basics of Counting Tree Diagrams Counting problems can be solved using tree diagrams. A tree consists of a root, a number of branches leaving the root, and possible additional branches leaving the endpoints of other branches. (We will study trees in detail in Chapter 11.)To use trees in counting, we use a branch to represent each possible choice. We represent the possible outcomes by the leaves , which are the endpoints of branches not having other branches starting at them.

Bijections In this lecture, we will look at using bijections to solve combinatorics problems . Given two sets A and B, a bijection (also called bijective correspondence ) is a map f : A \u2192 B that is both injective \uff08\u5355\u5c04\uff09 and surjective \uff08\u6ee1\u5c04\uff09, meaning that no two elements of A get mapped onto the same element in B, and every element of B is the image of some element of A . This gives us a way of pairing up every element from A with some element of B. In particular, when the sets are finite, the existence of a bijection implies that |A | = |B|. This explanation of a bijection may seem a little abstract. Let us take a look at some examples of how bijections can be used Problem 1. Q: Determine the number of walks from (0, 0) to (m, n) allowing only unit steps up or to the right A The idea of using bijection is that we want to tranform the problem into something that we know better how to count. In this case, we can encode the path as a sequence letters U and R, correponding to whether the step taken was a unit up step (U) or a unit right step (R). The path displayed above, for instance, is encoded as RRURRUURRURRUUURRU Note that the resulting sequence of letters always has m copies of R and n copies of U, since it takes in total of m right unit steps and n up unit steps to move from (0, 0) to (m, n). Also, you can check that for any sequence consisting of m copies of R and n copies of U, we can construct a corresponding path encoded by this sequence. Thus we have constructed a bijection between the following two sets: the set of walks from (0, 0) to (m, n) using only unit up or right steps \u200b /\\ \u200b | \u200b \\/ the set of sequences consisting of m copies of R and n copies of U. We know how to count the latter set. It has exactly \\tbinom {m+n} {m} \\tbinom {m+n} {m} elements, which can be thought of as choosing m spots to place the R\u2019s in a sequence of length m+n. Therefore, the number of lattice walks from (0, 0) to (m, n) must be \\tbinom {m+n} {n} \\tbinom {m+n} {n} as wel Next, let us explore the Catalan numbers , which is a sequence is that comes up in many counting problems, which provide a rich source for bijections. Problem 5 Q Let n n be a positive integer. Determine the number of lattice paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) using only unit up and right steps, such that the path stays in the region x \u2265 y. A We saw previously that the total number of lattice paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) without the x \u2265 y restriction is equal is \\tbinom {2 \\times n} {n} \\tbinom {2 \\times n} {n} . Let us count the number of paths that goes into the x < y region. Call these paths bad path Suppose that P is a bad path. Since P goes into the region x < y, it must hit the line y = x + 1 at some point. Let X be the first point on the path P that lies on the line y = x + 1. Now, reflect the portion of path P up to X about the line y = x + 1, keeping the latter portion of P the same. This gives us a new path P 0 . Problem 6 Q Show that the n-th Catalan number counts the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. E.g., for n = 3, ((())) (()()) (())() ()(()) ()()() We could solve this problem by counting it using techniques similar to the one used to count paths above. A much quicker solution is to find a bijection between these parentheses expressions and the lattice paths counted in the previous problem. Indeed, note that by interpretating each ( as a unit right step and each ) as a unit up step, we obtain the desired bijection . The condition that the parentheses expression is correctedly matched corresponds exactly to the condition that the lattice path do not go into the x < y region (why?). This bijection shows that the number of expressions of n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched is also equal to n-th Catalan number, as desired. The previous bijection was rather simple. Let us look at a more involved Catalan number bijection. A plane tree \uff08\u5e73\u9762\u6811\uff09 is an object with the following structure. We start with a root vertex (drawn at the top), and then with each node we attach a number of new vertices (possibly none), where the order of the attached vertices matters. For instance, there are exactly 5 plane trees with 4 vertices: Problem 7 Q Show that the n-th Catalan number counts the number of plane trees with n + 1 vertices. A We will produce a bijection between plane trees and the parentheses expressions considered in the previous problem. We first describe an algorithm to turn a plane tree into a parentheses expression . Given a plane tree \uff08\u5e73\u9762\u6811\uff09, starting from the top vertex , let us perform a depth-first search walk, meaning that we go as further down as possible until we hit a dead-end, and then backtrack to a branch point, where we then explore a new branch. We will always explore the branches of a vertex in order from left to right. For instance, starting with the plane \u56fe\u7565 we obtain the following walk, where the steps are labeled in order. \u56fe\u7565 Now we record the sequence of steps we took, writing down a ( each time we stepped downward along an edge, and a ) every time we stepped upward along an edge. For example, the above walk corresponds to A plane tree with n + 1 vertices always produces a correctly matched expression of n pairs of parentheses correctly matched (why is it correctly matched?). Conversely, given an expression of n pairs of correctly matched parentheses, it is possible to reverse this construction to produce a plane tree that corresponds to it. You should first convince yourself that this is the case why writing down a few parentheses expressions and then figure out what the corresponding tree is. Then, you should write down a description of this bijection.

It is essentially used to prove that a property P ( n ) holds for every natural number n , i.e. for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Metaphors can be informally used to understand the concept of mathematical induction, such as the metaphor of falling dominoes\uff08\u591a\u7c73\u8bfa\u9aa8\u724c\uff09 or climbing a ladder\uff08\u68af\u5b50\uff09. The method of induction requires two cases to be proved. The first case, called the base case (or, sometimes, the basis ), proves that the property holds for the number 0. The second case, called the induction step , proves that if the property holds for one natural number n , then it holds for the next natural number n+1 . These two steps establish the property P(n) for every natural number n=0,1,2,3... The method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees ; this generalization, known as structural induction , is used in mathematical logic and computer science . Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion . Mathematical induction, in some form, is the foundation of all correctness proofs for computer programs . \u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u78b0\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u662f structural induction \u3002 \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 Structural induction NOTE: \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7684\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u597d Structural induction is a proof method that is used in mathematical logic (e.g., in the proof of \u0141o\u015b' theorem ), computer science , graph theory , and some other mathematical fields. It is a generalization of mathematical induction over natural numbers and can be further generalized to arbitrary Noetherian induction . Structural recursion is a recursion method bearing the same relationship to structural induction as ordinary recursion bears to ordinary mathematical induction .

A well-founded partial order is defined on the structures (\"subformula\" for formulas, \"sublist\" for lists, and \"subtree\" for trees). The structural induction proof is a proof that the proposition holds for all the minimal structures and that if it holds for the immediate substructures of a certain structure S , then it must hold for S also. (Formally speaking, this then satisfies the premises of an axiom of well-founded induction , which asserts that these two conditions are sufficient for the proposition to hold for all x .) A structurally recursive function uses the same idea to define a recursive function: \"base cases\" handle each minimal structure and a rule for recursion. Structural recursion is usually proved correct by structural induction ; in particularly easy cases, the inductive step is often left out.

It is essentially used to prove that a property P ( n ) holds for every natural number n , i.e. for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Metaphors can be informally used to understand the concept of mathematical induction, such as the metaphor of falling dominoes\uff08\u591a\u7c73\u8bfa\u9aa8\u724c\uff09 or climbing a ladder\uff08\u68af\u5b50\uff09. The method of induction requires two cases to be proved. The first case, called the base case (or, sometimes, the basis ), proves that the property holds for the number 0. The second case, called the induction step , proves that if the property holds for one natural number n , then it holds for the next natural number n+1 . These two steps establish the property P(n) for every natural number n=0,1,2,3... The method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees ; this generalization, known as structural induction , is used in mathematical logic and computer science . Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion . Mathematical induction, in some form, is the foundation of all correctness proofs for computer programs . \u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u78b0\u5230\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u662f structural induction \u3002","title":"\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1Mathematical induction"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Induction-and-deduction/Induction/#structural#induction","text":"NOTE: \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u7684\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u597d Structural induction is a proof method that is used in mathematical logic (e.g., in the proof of \u0141o\u015b' theorem ), computer science , graph theory , and some other mathematical fields. It is a generalization of mathematical induction over natural numbers and can be further generalized to arbitrary Noetherian induction .

A well-founded partial order is defined on the structures (\"subformula\" for formulas, \"sublist\" for lists, and \"subtree\" for trees). The structural induction proof is a proof that the proposition holds for all the minimal structures and that if it holds for the immediate substructures of a certain structure S , then it must hold for S also. (Formally speaking, this then satisfies the premises of an axiom of well-founded induction , which asserts that these two conditions are sufficient for the proposition to hold for all x .) A structurally recursive function uses the same idea to define a recursive function: \"base cases\" handle each minimal structure and a rule for recursion. Structural recursion is usually proved correct by structural induction ; in particularly easy cases, the inductive step is often left out.

A familiar example is the Fibonacci number sequence: F ( n ) = F ( n \u2212 1) + F ( n \u2212 2). For such a definition to be useful, it must be reducible to non-recursively defined values: in this case F (0) = 0 and F (1) = 1. A famous recursive function is the Ackermann function , which, unlike the Fibonacci sequence, cannot be expressed without recursion.

Corecursion can produce both finite and infinite data structures as results, and may employ self-referential data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation , to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in functional programming , where corecursion and codata allow total languages to work with infinite data structures.

While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the generator facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and assigned values imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables , these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition. Factorial A classic example of recursion is computing the factorial \uff08\u9636\u4e58\uff09, which is defined recursively by 0! := 1 and n! := n \u00d7 (n - 1)! . To recursively compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) itself with a different (\"smaller\" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the base case has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute fac(3) , this recursively calls in turn fac(2) , fac(1) , fac(0) (\"winding up\" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with fac(0) = 1 , and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame fac(3) that uses the result of fac(2) = 2 to calculate the final result as 3 \u00d7 2 = 3 \u00d7 fac(2) =: fac(3) and finally return fac(3) = 6 . In this example a function returns a single value. This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial corecursively , as an iterator , where one starts with the case of $ 1=:0! $, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers 1, 2, 3... as in the above recursive definition with \"time arrow\" reversed, as it were, by reading it backwards as $ n!\\times (n+1)=:(n+1)! $. The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a stream of all factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a generator . Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both n and f (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as: $ n,f=(0,1):(n+1,f\\times (n+1)) $ In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as: def factorial ( n ): if n == 0 : return 1 else : return n * factorial ( n - 1 ) This could then be called for example as factorial(5) to compute 5! . A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as: def factorials (): n , f = 0 , 1 while True : yield f n , f = n + 1 , f * ( n + 1 ) This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by: def n_factorials ( k ): n , f = 0 , 1 while n <= k : yield f n , f = n + 1 , f * ( n + 1 ) This could then be called to produce the factorials up to 5! via: for f in n_factorials ( 5 ): print ( f ) If we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function, def nth_factorial ( k ): n , f = 0 , 1 while n < k : n , f = n + 1 , f * ( n + 1 ) yield f As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting return for the only yield there) to the accumulator argument technique for tail recursion , unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable. \u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6837\u8bf4\uff0c\u534f\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5b9a\u4e49\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u3002 Fibonacci sequence In the same way, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as: $ a,b=(0,1):(b,a+b) $ Note that because the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the $ (b,-) $ corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the $ (-,a+b) $ corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using parallel assignment ): def fibonacci_sequence (): a , b = 0 , 1 while True : yield a a , b = b , a + b In Haskell, map fst ( ( \\ ( a , b ) -> ( b , a + b )) ` iterate ` ( 0 , 1 ) ) Tree traversal Tree traversal via a depth-first approach is a classic example of recursion . Dually, breadth-first traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion . Without using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node , placing its child nodes in a data structure , then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure.[ b] If the data structure is a stack (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal , and if the data structure is a queue (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal .

Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions ) acts as the stack that is iterated over. Using corecursion , a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value,[ d] then breadth-first traversing the subtrees \u2013 i.e., passing on the whole list of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) \u2013 at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc.[ e] In this case the generator function , indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue .

Some functional programming languages do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to repeatedly call code. Computability theory proves that these recursive-only languages are Turing complete ; they are as computationally powerful as Turing complete imperative languages, meaning they can solve the same kinds of problems as imperative languages even without iterative control structures such as while and for . Recursive functions and algorithms A common computer programming tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, solve those sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the divide-and-conquer method ; when combined with a lookup table that stores the results of solving sub-problems (to avoid solving them repeatedly and incurring extra computation time), it can be referred to as dynamic programming or memoization .

For example, the factorial function can be defined recursively by the equations 0! = 1 and, for all n > 0, n ! = n ( n \u2212 1)!. Neither equation by itself constitutes a complete definition; the first is the base case, and the second is the recursive case. Because the base case breaks the chain of recursion, it is sometimes also called the \"terminating case\". The job of the recursive cases can be seen as breaking down complex inputs into simpler ones. In a properly designed recursive function, with each recursive call, the input problem must be simplified in such a way that eventually the base case must be reached. (Functions that are not intended to terminate under normal circumstances\u2014for example, some system and server processes \u2014are an exception to this.) Neglecting(\u5fd8\u8bb0\u3001\u5ffd\u7565) to write a base case, or testing for it incorrectly, can cause an infinite loop .

Such an example is more naturally treated by co-recursion , where successive terms in the output are the partial sums; this can be converted to a recursion by using the indexing parameter to say \"compute the *n*th term (*n*th partial sum)\".

Recursion is one technique for representing data whose exact size the programmer does not know: the programmer can specify this data with a self-referential definition. There are two types of self-referential definitions : inductive and coinductive definitions. Further information: Algebraic data type Inductively defined data Main article: Recursive data type Similarly recursive definitions are often used to model the structure of expressions and statements in programming languages. Language designers often express grammars in a syntax such as Backus\u2013Naur form ; here is such a grammar, for a simple language of arithmetic expressions with multiplication and addition: <expr> ::= <number> | (<expr> * <expr>) | (<expr> + <expr>) This says that an expression is either a number, a product of two expressions, or a sum of two expressions. By recursively referring to expressions in the second and third lines, the grammar permits arbitrarily complex arithmetic expressions such as (5 * ((3 * 6) + 8)) , with more than one product or sum operation in a single expression. Coinductively defined data and corecursion Main articles: Coinduction and Corecursion A coinductive definition of infinite streams of strings, given informally, might look like this: A stream of strings is an object s such that: head(s) is a string, and tail(s) is a stream of strings. Types of recursion Single recursion and multiple recursion Recursion that only contains a single self-reference is known as single recursion , while recursion that contains multiple self-references is known as multiple recursion . Standard examples of single recursion include list traversal, such as in a linear search, or computing the factorial function, while standard examples of multiple recursion include tree traversal , such as in a depth-first search . NOTE: 1\u3001\u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u4e00\u6bb5\u7684\u603b\u7ed3\u975e\u5e38\u597d Single recursion is often much more efficient than multiple recursion , and can generally be replaced by an iterative computation , running in linear time and requiring constant space. Multiple recursion , by contrast, may require exponential time and space, and is more fundamentally recursive, not being able to be replaced by iteration without an explicit stack .

For example, while computing the Fibonacci sequence naively is multiple iteration, as each value requires two previous values , it can be computed by single recursion by passing two successive values as parameters. This is more naturally framed as corecursion , building up from the initial values , tracking at each step two successive values \u2013 see corecursion: examples . A more sophisticated example is using a threaded binary tree , which allows iterative tree traversal, rather than multiple recursion.

Indirect recursion occurs when a function is called not by itself but by another function that it called (either directly or indirectly). For example, if f calls f, that is direct recursion, but if f calls g which calls f, then that is indirect recursion of f. Chains of three or more functions are possible; for example, function 1 calls function 2, function 2 calls function 3, and function 3 calls function 1 again. Indirect recursion is also called mutual recursion , which is a more symmetric term, though this is simply a difference of emphasis, not a different notion. That is, if f calls g and then g calls f, which in turn calls g again, from the point of view of f alone, f is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of g alone, it is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of both, f and g are mutually recursing on each other. Similarly a set of three or more functions that call each other can be called a set of mutually recursive functions. Anonymous recursion Main article: Anonymous recursion Recursion is usually done by explicitly calling a function by name. However, recursion can also be done via implicitly calling a function based on the current context, which is particularly useful for anonymous functions , and is known as anonymous recursion . Structural versus generative recursion NOTE: 1\u3001\u53c2\u89c1 Structural-and-generative-recursion \u7ae0\u8282 Recursive programs NOTE: 1\u3001\u53c2\u89c1 Recursive-programs \u7ae0\u8282 Implementation issues In actual implementation, rather than a pure recursive function (single check for base case, otherwise recursive step), a number of modifications may be made, for purposes of clarity or efficiency. These include: Wrapper function (at top) Short-circuiting\uff08\u7b80\u5316\uff09 the base case , aka \"Arm's-length recursion\" (at bottom) Hybrid algorithm (at bottom) \u2013 switching to a different algorithm once data is small enough On the basis of elegance, wrapper functions are generally approved, while short-circuiting the base case is frowned upon, particularly in academia. Hybrid algorithms are often used for efficiency, to reduce the overhead of recursion in small cases, and arm's-length recursion is a special case of this. Recursion versus iteration Recursion and iteration are equally expressive: recursion can be replaced by iteration with an explicit call stack , while iteration can be replaced with tail recursion . Which approach is preferable depends on the problem under consideration and the language used. In imperative programming , iteration is preferred, particularly for simple recursion, as it avoids the overhead of function calls and call stack management, but recursion is generally used for multiple recursion . By contrast, in functional languages recursion is preferred, with tail recursion optimization leading to little overhead. Implementing an algorithm using iteration may not be easily achievable. For example, a factorial function may be implemented iteratively in C by assigning to an loop index variable and accumulator variable, rather than by passing arguments and returning values by recursion: unsigned int factorial ( unsigned int n ) { unsigned int product = 1 ; // empty product is 1 while ( n ) { product *= n ; -- n ; } return product ; } Multiply recursive problems Multiply recursive problems are inherently recursive, because of prior state they need to track. One example is tree traversal as in depth-first search ; though both recursive and iterative methods are used,[ 19] they contrast with list traversal and linear search in a list, which is a singly recursive and thus naturally iterative method. Other examples include divide-and-conquer algorithms such as Quicksort , and functions such as the Ackermann function . All of these algorithms can be implemented iteratively with the help of an explicit stack , but the programmer effort involved in managing the stack, and the complexity of the resulting program, arguably outweigh any advantages of the iterative solution. Refactoring recursion Recursive algorithms can be replaced with non-recursive counterparts.[ 20] . One method for replacing recursive algorithms is to simulate them using heap memory in place of stack memory .[ 21] An alternative is to develop a replacement algorithm entirely based on non-recursive methods, which can be challenging.[ 22] For example, recursive algorithms for matching wildcards , such as Rich Salz ' wildmat algorithm,[ 23] were once typical. Non-recursive algorithms for the same purpose, such as the Krauss matching wildcards algorithm , have been developed to avoid the drawbacks of recursion[ 24] and have improved only gradually based on techniques such as collecting tests and profiling performance.[ 25] Tail-recursive functions Tail-recursive functions are functions in which all recursive calls are tail calls and hence do not build up any deferred operations. For example, the gcd function (shown again below) is tail-recursive. In contrast, the factorial function (also below) is not tail-recursive; because its recursive call is not in tail position, it builds up deferred multiplication operations that must be performed after the final recursive call completes. With a compiler or interpreter that treats tail-recursive calls as jumps rather than function calls , a tail-recursive function such as gcd will execute using constant space . Thus the program is essentially iterative, equivalent to using imperative language control structures like the \"for\" and \"while\" loops. Tail recursion : //INPUT: Integers x, y such that x >= y and y >= 0 int gcd ( int x , int y ) { if ( y == 0 ) return x ; else return gcd ( y , x % y ); } Augmenting recursion: //INPUT: n is an Integer such that n >= 0 int fact ( int n ) { if ( n == 0 ) return 1 ; else return n * fact ( n - 1 ); } The significance of tail recursion is that when making a tail-recursive call (or any tail call), the caller's return position need not be saved on the call stack ; when the recursive call returns, it will branch directly on the previously saved return position. Therefore, in languages that recognize this property of tail calls, tail recursion saves both space and time. Time-efficiency of recursive algorithms The time efficiency of recursive algorithms can be expressed in a recurrence relation of Big O notation . They can (usually) then be simplified into a single Big-O term. Shortcut rule (master theorem) Main article: Master theorem (analysis of algorithms) If the time-complexity of the function is in the form $ T(n)=a\\cdot T(n/b)+f(n) $ Then the Big O of the time-complexity is thus: If $ f(n)=O(n^{\\log _{b}a-\\epsilon }) $ for some constant $ \\epsilon >0 $, then $ T(n)=\\Theta (n^{\\log _{b}a}) $ If $ f(n)=\\Theta (n^{\\log _{b}a}) $, then $ T(n)=\\Theta (n^{\\log _{b}a}\\log n) $ If $ f(n)=\\Omega (n^{\\log _{b}a+\\epsilon }) $ for some constant $ \\epsilon >0 $, and if $ a\\cdot f(n/b)\\leq c\\cdot f(n) $ for some constant c < 1 and all sufficiently large n , then $ T(n)=\\Theta (f(n)) $ where a represents the number of recursive calls at each level of recursion, b represents by what factor smaller the input is for the next level of recursion (i.e. the number of pieces you divide the problem into), and f \u2009( n ) represents the work the function does independent of any recursion (e.g. partitioning, recombining) at each level of recursion.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Recursion/Recursion-in-computer-science/Recursion%28computer-science%29/#wikipedia#recursion#computer#science","text":"NOTE: 1\u3001\u5728\"Recursion\"\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a5\u89e6\u4e86recursion \u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5206\u6790computer science\u4e2d\u7684recursion\u3002 Recursion in computer science is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration ).

For example, a factorial function may be implemented iteratively in C by assigning to an loop index variable and accumulator variable, rather than by passing arguments and returning values by recursion: unsigned int factorial ( unsigned int n ) { unsigned int product = 1 ; // empty product is 1 while ( n ) { product *= n ; -- n ; } return product ; }","title":"Recursion versus iteration"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Recursion/Recursion-in-computer-science/Recursion%28computer-science%29/#multiply#recursive#problems","text":"Multiply recursive problems are inherently recursive, because of prior state they need to track.

For example, the gcd function (shown again below) is tail-recursive. In contrast, the factorial function (also below) is not tail-recursive; because its recursive call is not in tail position, it builds up deferred multiplication operations that must be performed after the final recursive call completes. With a compiler or interpreter that treats tail-recursive calls as jumps rather than function calls , a tail-recursive function such as gcd will execute using constant space . Thus the program is essentially iterative, equivalent to using imperative language control structures like the \"for\" and \"while\" loops. Tail recursion : //INPUT: Integers x, y such that x >= y and y >= 0 int gcd ( int x , int y ) { if ( y == 0 ) return x ; else return gcd ( y , x % y ); } Augmenting recursion: //INPUT: n is an Integer such that n >= 0 int fact ( int n ) { if ( n == 0 ) return 1 ; else return n * fact ( n - 1 ); } The significance of tail recursion is that when making a tail-recursive call (or any tail call), the caller's return position need not be saved on the call stack ; when the recursive call returns, it will branch directly on the previously saved return position.

Towers of Hanoi Main article: Towers of Hanoi The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion.[ 6] [ 7] There are three pegs which can hold stacks of disks of different diameters. A larger disk may never be stacked on top of a smaller. Starting with n disks on one peg, they must be moved to another peg one at a time. What is the smallest number of steps to move the stack?

The trick is to pick a midpoint near the center of the array, compare the data at that point with the data being searched and then responding to one of three possible conditions: the data is found at the midpoint, the data at the midpoint is greater than the data being searched for, or the data at the midpoint is less than the data being searched for. Recursion is used in this algorithm because with each pass a new array is created by cutting the old one in half. The binary search procedure is then called recursively, this time on the new (and smaller) array. Typically the array's size is adjusted by manipulating a beginning and ending index. The algorithm exhibits a logarithmic order of growth because it essentially divides the problem domain in half with each pass. Example implementation of binary search in C: /* Call binary_search with proper initial conditions. INPUT: data is an array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order, toFind is the integer to search for, count is the total number of elements in the array OUTPUT: result of binary_search */ int search ( int * data , int toFind , int count ) { // Start = 0 (beginning index) // End = count - 1 (top index) return binary_search ( data , toFind , 0 , count -1 ); } /* Binary Search Algorithm. INPUT: data is a array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order, toFind is the integer to search for, start is the minimum array index, end is the maximum array index OUTPUT: position of the integer toFind within array data, -1 if not found */ int binary_search ( int * data , int toFind , int start , int end ) { //Get the midpoint. int mid = start + ( end - start ) / 2 ; //Integer division //Stop condition. if ( start > end ) return -1 ; else if ( data [ mid ] == toFind ) //Found? return mid ; else if ( data [ mid ] > toFind ) //Data is greater than toFind, search lower half return binary_search ( data , toFind , start , mid -1 ); else //Data is less than toFind, search upper half return binary_search ( data , toFind , mid + 1 , end ); } Recursive data structures (structural recursion) Main article: Recursive data type An important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as lists and trees . Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to a theoretically infinite size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, the size of a static array must be set at compile time. \" Recursive algorithms are particularly appropriate when the underlying problem or the data to be treated are defined in recursive terms.\"[ 9] The examples in this section illustrate what is known as \" structural recursion \". This term refers to the fact that the recursive procedures are acting on data that is defined recursively. As long as a programmer derives the template from a data definition, functions employ structural recursion. That is, the recursions in a function's body consume some immediate piece of a given compound value.[ 5] Linked lists Main article: Linked list Below is a C definition of a linked list node structure. Notice especially how the node is defined in terms of itself. The \"next\" element of struct node is a pointer to another struct node , effectively creating a list type. struct node { int data ; // some integer data struct node * next ; // pointer to another struct node }; Because the struct node data structure is defined recursively , procedures that operate on it can be implemented naturally as recursive procedures . The list_print procedure defined below walks down the list until the list is empty (i.e., the list pointer has a value of NULL). For each node it prints the data element (an integer). In the C implementation, the list remains unchanged by the list_print procedure. void list_print ( struct node * list ) { if ( list != NULL ) // base case { printf ( \"%d \" , list -> data ); // print integer data followed by a space list_print ( list -> next ); // recursive call on the next node } } Binary trees Main article: Binary tree Below is a simple definition for a binary tree node. Like the node for linked lists, it is defined in terms of itself, recursively. There are two self-referential pointers: left (pointing to the left sub-tree) and right (pointing to the right sub-tree). struct node { int data ; // some integer data struct node * left ; // pointer to the left subtree struct node * right ; // point to the right subtree }; Operations on the tree can be implemented using recursion. Note that because there are two self-referencing pointers (left and right), tree operations may require two recursive calls: // Test if tree_node contains i; return 1 if so, 0 if not. int tree_contains ( struct node * tree_node , int i ) { if ( tree_node == NULL ) return 0 ; // base case else if ( tree_node -> data == i ) return 1 ; else return tree_contains ( tree_node -> left , i ) || tree_contains ( tree_node -> right , i ); } At most two recursive calls will be made for any given call to tree_contains as defined above. // Inorder traversal: void tree_print ( struct node * tree_node ) { if ( tree_node != NULL ) { // base case tree_print ( tree_node -> left ); // go left printf ( \"%d \" , tree_node -> data ); // print the integer followed by a space tree_print ( tree_node -> right ); // go right } } 5 3 7 2 4 6 8 P(5) P(3) P(2) P(NULL) return printf(2) P(NULL) return printf(3) p(4) P(NULL) return printf(4) P(NULL) return \u5199\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u628a\u6211\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff1a\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u89e3\u4e86\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5806\u6808\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5806\u6808\u80fd\u591f\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u6309\u7167\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u5165\u6808\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u51fa\u6808\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u4e00\u5c42\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u81f3\u6700\u9876\u5c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\uff1b \u6bcf\u4e2a\u9012\u5f52\u8c03\u7528\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u6761\u76f4\u7ebf\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u6b21\u9012\u5f52\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5219\u5c31\u662f\u4e24\u6761\u7ebf\u4e86\uff1b \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8005\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u4e0a\u8ff0\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u53bb\u7f16\u5199\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5f53\u8c08\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u8005\u6a21\u62df\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5c31\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u6765\u6267\u884c\u3002","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Recursion/Recursion-in-computer-science/Recursion%28computer-science%29/Recursive-programs/#wikipedia#recursion#computer#science#recursive#programs","text":"","title":"wikipedia Recursion (computer science) # Recursive programs"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Recursion/Recursion-in-computer-science/Recursion%28computer-science%29/Recursive-programs/#recursive#procedures","text":"","title":"Recursive procedures"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Recursion/Recursion-in-computer-science/Recursion%28computer-science%29/Recursive-programs/#factorial","text":"","title":"Factorial"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Repetition/Induction-and-Recursion/Recursion/Recursion-in-computer-science/Recursion%28computer-science%29/Recursive-programs/#greatest#common#divisor","text":"The Euclidean algorithm , which computes the greatest common divisor of two integers, can be written recursively.

The description of generative recursion in Wikipedia is clear to me, but I'm confused about the concept of structural recursion.

COMMENTS My two pennies: Fib is generative recursive using that definition because the data is \"generated\" as it goes along. Whereas, according to the article, structural recursion is about traversing an [existing] graph. The article goes on to state that an crucial distinction is that structural recursion can be proven to terminate through structural induction .. \u2013 user166390 A The key difference between structural and generative recursion is where a recursive procedure gets the data that it works on and how it processes that data\uff08 \" recursive procedure gets the data that it works on\"\u5176\u5b9e\u5c31\u662frecursion function\u7684**\u5165\u53c2**\uff09. Specifically, for structural recursion , a recursive call is made on a subset of the original input data. Whereas for generative recursion , a recursive call is made on data that was constructed/calculated from the original input data. NOTE: \u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u603b\u7ed3\u5730\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\uff1b For example, if you wanted to count the number of elements in a linked list, you could do the following: int NumberOfNodes ( ListNode * node ) { if ( node == nullptr ) return 0 ; return 1 + NumberOfNodes ( node -> next ); } Here, the recursive call to NumberOfNodes is being made on node->next , which is a piece of the original input which already existed. In this case, the recursion works by breaking down the input into smaller pieces, then recursing on the smaller pieces. Similarly, this code to search a BST for a value would be structural recursion, because the recursive calls are to subparts of the original input: TreeNode * Find ( TreeNode * root , DataType value ) { if ( root == nullptr ) return nullptr ; if ( value < root -> value ) return Find ( root -> left , value ); else return Find ( root -> right , value ); The term \"structural recursion\" comes from the fact that these structures (lists, BSTs, etc.) can be defined recursively: A list is either nothing, or a cell followed by a list. A binary tree is either nothing, or a node with two binary trees as children. When doing structural recursion, you are \"undoing\"(\u89e3\u5f00\u3001\u62c6\u89e3) the operation from which these structures are built out of one another. For example, the NumberOfNodes function \"undoes\" the construction of taking a node and prepending it to an existing list. The Find operator \"undoes\" the operation of gluing(\u7c98\u5408) a node to two other trees. Therefore, it's easy to see why these functions have to terminate - eventually, you \"undo\" all of the operations that went in to building up the object in the first place, and the recursion stops.

Here, the recursive calls are being made on smaller arrays that weren't part of the original input - the lists had to be created from the data. (Typically, an implementation would reuse space for these lists, but those sublists weren't guaranteed to exist directly within the input). This distinction is blurry\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\uff09 when it comes to natural numbers . Usually, natural numbers are recursively defined as follows: 0 is a natural number. If n is a natural number, n + 1 is a natural number. Nothing else is a natural number. Under this definition, the number n is a \"part\" of n + 1 . Therefore, this recursive code to compute n! is structural recursion: int Factorial ( int n ) { if ( n == 0 ) return 1 ; return n * Factorial ( n - 1 ); } This is structural recursion, because the argument n - 1 was a \"part\" of the original input n. Similarly, by this definition, computing the nth Fibonacci number recursively counts as structural recursion: int Fibonacci ( int n ) { if ( n <= 1 ) return n ; return Fibonacci ( n - 1 ) + Fibonacci ( n - 2 ); } This is considered structural recursion because n - 1 is a part of n (formed by \"undoing\" the +1) and n - 2 is a part of n - 1 (again formed by \"undoing\" the +1). On the other hand, this code to compute gcd would be considered generative recursion, rather than structural recursion: int gcd ( int a , int b ) { if ( b == 0 ) return a ; return gcd ( b , a % b ); } The reasoning is that since a % b is \"computed\" from a and b , rather than formed by \"undoing\" some number of +1 operations, the data is generated. The reason that generative recursion is different from structural recursion is that there's no guarantee that it terminates. For example, think about this function: int BadTimes ( int a , int b ) { if ( a == 0 && b == 0 ) return 0 ; return BadTimes ( a * 2 , b - 1 ); } This generative recursive function never terminates: a keeps getting bigger even though b keeps getting smaller. Honestly, I've never heard of this distinction before and I teach courses in discrete math and programming. I wouldn't worry too much about it unless someone is requiring you to know the difference.

Where the domain of the function is the natural numbers , sufficient conditions for the definition to be valid are that the value of f(0) (i.e., base case) is given, and that for n > 0, an algorithm is given for determining f(n) in terms of f(0) , f(1) , ... , f(n-1) (i.e., inductive clause). More generally, recursive definitions of functions can be made whenever the domain is a well-ordered set , using the principle of transfinite recursion . The formal criteria for what constitutes a valid recursive definition are more complex for the general case.

Where the domain of the function is the natural numbers , sufficient conditions for the definition to be valid are that the value of f(0) (i.e., base case) is given, and that for n > 0, an algorithm is given for determining f(n) in terms of f(0) , f(1) , ... , f(n-1) (i.e., inductive clause).

particularly lists . Various types of iterators are often provided via a container's interface . Though the interface and semantics of a given iterator are fixed, iterators are often implemented in terms of the structures underlying a container implementation and are often tightly coupled to the container to enable the operational semantics of the iterator. An iterator performs traversal and also gives access to data elements in a container, but does not itself perform iteration (i.e., not without some significant liberty taken with that concept or with trivial use of the terminology). An iterator is behaviorally similar to a database cursor .

There must also be a way to create an iterator so it points to some first element as well as some way to determine when the iterator has exhausted all of the elements in the container.

stack\u6765\u4fdd\u5b58deferred node\uff0c\u6b63\u5982 Tree traversal \u4e2d\u6240\u8ff0\uff1a Traversing a tree involves iterating over all nodes in some manner. Because from a given node there is more than one possible next node (it is not a linear data structure), then, assuming sequential computation (not parallel), some nodes must be deferred\u2014stored in some way for later visiting. This is often done via a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). As a tree is a self-referential (recursively defined) data structure, traversal can be defined by recursion or, more subtly, corecursion , in a very natural and clear fashion; in these cases the deferred nodes are stored implicitly in the call stack .

Because from a given node there is more than one possible next node (it is not a linear data structure), then, assuming sequential computation (not parallel), some nodes must be deferred\u2014stored in some way for later visiting. This is often done via a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). As a tree is a self-referential (recursively defined) data structure, traversal can be defined by recursion or, more subtly, corecursion , in a very natural and clear fashion; in these cases the deferred nodes are stored implicitly in the call stack .

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata , as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics (a subject of study in both mathematics and computer science ). The word automata (the plural of automaton ) comes from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, which means \"self-making\". The figure at right illustrates a finite-state machine , which belongs to a well-known type of automaton. This automaton\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff09 consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows). As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function , which takes the current state and the recent symbol as its inputs. Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory. An automaton is a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set . Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, typically illustrated by the Chomsky hierarchy , which describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logics. TIPS: It is obvious that automata theory is an important tool for research formal language. Automata play a major role in theory of computation , compiler construction \uff08\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u6784\u5efa\uff09, artificial intelligence , parsing and formal verification . Classes of automata: Turing machine Pushdown automaton Finite-state machine Combinational logic The study of the mathematical properties of such automata is automata theory. The picture is a visualization of an automaton that recognizes strings containing an even number of 0*s. The automaton starts in state *S1 , and transitions to the non-accepting state S2 upon reading the symbol 0 . Reading another 0 causes the automaton to transition back to the accepting state S1 . In both states the symbol 1 is ignored by making a transition to the current state. TIPS: The diagram above is called a state diagram . Automata Following is an introductory definition of one type of automaton, which attempts to help one grasp the essential concepts involved in automata theory/theories. Informal description An automaton runs when it is given some sequence of inputs in discrete (individual) time steps or steps. An automaton processes one input picked from a set of symbols or letters , which is called an alphabet . The symbols received by the automaton as input at any step are a finite sequence of symbols called words . An automaton has a finite set of states . At each moment during a run of the automaton, the automaton is in one of its states. When the automaton receives new input it moves to another state (or transitions) based on a function that takes the current state and symbol as parameters. This function is called the transition function . The automaton reads the symbols of the input word one after another and transitions from state to state according to the transition function until the word is read completely. Once the input word has been read, the automaton is said to have stopped. The state at which the automaton stops is called the final state . Depending on the final state , it's said that the automaton either accepts or rejects an input word. There is a subset of states of the automaton, which is defined as the set of accepting states . If the final state is an accepting state , then the automaton accepts the word. Otherwise, the word is rejected . The set of all the words accepted by an automaton is called the language recognized by the automaton . In short, an automaton is a mathematical object that takes a word as input and decides whether to accept it or reject it. Since all computational problems are reducible into the accept/reject question on inputs, (all problem instances can be represented in a finite length of symbols), automata theory plays a crucial role in computational theory . TIPS: In formal language, automata act as recognizer or matcher consuming characters or tokens . The graph above is a good example of automaton. Automata can be used not only in formal language, it has many application in computer science, such as: Event-driven finite-state machine State machine replication In these applications, what automaton consume can be event.

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata , as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics (a subject of study in both mathematics and computer science ). The word automata (the plural of automaton ) comes from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, which means \"self-making\". The figure at right illustrates a finite-state machine , which belongs to a well-known type of automaton. This automaton\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff09 consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows). As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function , which takes the current state and the recent symbol as its inputs. Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory. An automaton is a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set . Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, typically illustrated by the Chomsky hierarchy , which describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logics. TIPS: It is obvious that automata theory is an important tool for research formal language. Automata play a major role in theory of computation , compiler construction \uff08\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u6784\u5efa\uff09, artificial intelligence , parsing and formal verification . Classes of automata: Turing machine Pushdown automaton Finite-state machine Combinational logic The study of the mathematical properties of such automata is automata theory. The picture is a visualization of an automaton that recognizes strings containing an even number of 0*s. The automaton starts in state *S1 , and transitions to the non-accepting state S2 upon reading the symbol 0 . Reading another 0 causes the automaton to transition back to the accepting state S1 . In both states the symbol 1 is ignored by making a transition to the current state.

An automaton processes one input picked from a set of symbols or letters , which is called an alphabet . The symbols received by the automaton as input at any step are a finite sequence of symbols called words . An automaton has a finite set of states . At each moment during a run of the automaton, the automaton is in one of its states. When the automaton receives new input it moves to another state (or transitions) based on a function that takes the current state and symbol as parameters. This function is called the transition function . The automaton reads the symbols of the input word one after another and transitions from state to state according to the transition function until the word is read completely. Once the input word has been read, the automaton is said to have stopped. The state at which the automaton stops is called the final state . Depending on the final state , it's said that the automaton either accepts or rejects an input word. There is a subset of states of the automaton, which is defined as the set of accepting states . If the final state is an accepting state , then the automaton accepts the word. Otherwise, the word is rejected . The set of all the words accepted by an automaton is called the language recognized by the automaton . In short, an automaton is a mathematical object that takes a word as input and decides whether to accept it or reject it.

It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs and/or a condition is satisfied; the change from one state to another is called a transition .[ 1] An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition. Finite state machines are of two types: deterministic finite state machines non-deterministic finite state machines .[ 2] A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one. The behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. Simple examples are vending machines , which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited, elevators , whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders, traffic lights , which change sequence when cars are waiting, and combination locks , which require the input of a sequence of numbers in the proper order. TIPS: The state machine can do much more, see Usage for more detail. The finite state machine has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the Turing machine .[ 3] The computational power distinction means there are computational tasks that a Turing machine can do but a FSM cannot. This is because a FSM's memory is limited by the number of states it has. FSMs are studied in the more general field of automata theory . TIPS: Turing machine operates on an infinite memory. TIPS: There is an incomplete hierarchy in terms of powers of different types of abstract machines in page automata theory Concepts and terminology A state is a description of the status of a system that is waiting to execute a transition . A transition is a set of actions to be executed when a condition is fulfilled or when an event is received. For example, when using an audio system to listen to the radio (the system is in the \"radio\" state), receiving a \"next\" stimulus results in moving to the next station. When the system is in the \"CD\" state, the \"next\" stimulus results in moving to the next track. Identical stimuli trigger different actions depending on the current state. In some finite-state machine representations, it is also possible to associate actions with a state: an entry action: performed when entering the state, and an exit action: performed when exiting the state. Representations state transition table UML state machines SDL state machines State diagram Classification Finite state machines can be subdivided into transducers\uff08\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff09 acceptors classifiers sequencers.[ 6] Acceptors (recognizers) Acceptors (also called recognizers and sequence detectors ), produce binary output , indicating whether or not the received input is accepted. Each state of an FSM is either \"accepting\" or \"not accepting\". Once all input has been received, if the current state is an accepting state , the input is accepted; otherwise it is rejected. As a rule, input is a sequence of symbols (characters); actions are not used. The example in figure 4 shows a finite state machine that accepts the string \"nice\". In this FSM, the only accepting state is state 7. TIPS: In machine learning terms, it's a dichotomy. Fig. 4 Acceptor FSM: parsing the string \"nice\" A (possibly infinite) set of symbol sequences, aka. formal language, is called a regular language if there is some Finite State Machine that accepts exactly that set. For example, the set of binary strings with an even number of zeroes is a regular language (cf. Fig. 5), while the set of all strings whose length is a prime number is not. Fig. 5: Representation of a finite-state machine; this example shows one that determines whether a binary number has an even number of 0s, where S*1 is an **accepting state* . A machine could also be described as defining a language, that would contain every string accepted by the machine but none of the rejected ones; that language is \"accepted\" by the machine. By definition, the languages accepted by FSMs are the regular languages \u2014; a language is regular if there is some FSM that accepts it. The problem of determining the language accepted by a given finite state acceptor is an instance of the algebraic path problem \u2014itself a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs with edges weighted by the elements of an (arbitrary) semiring . TIPS: This passage reminds me of regular expression . The start state can also be an accepting state, in which case the automaton accepts the empty string. An example of an accepting state appears in Fig.5: a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that detects whether the binary input string contains an even number of 0s. S*1 (which is also the start state) indicates the state at which an even number of 0s has been input. S1 is therefore an **accepting state* . This machine will finish in an accept state , if the binary string contains an even number of 0s (including any binary string containing no 0s). Examples of strings accepted by this DFA are \u03b5 (the empty string ), 1, 11, 11\u2026, 00, 010, 1010, 10110, etc. Classifiers A classifier is a generalization of a finite state machine that, similar to an acceptor, produces a single output on termination but has more than two terminal states. TIPS: In machine learning terms, it's a multi-class classifier. Determinism A further distinction is between deterministic ( DFA ) and non-deterministic ( NFA , GNFA ) automata. In a deterministic automaton, every state has exactly one transition for each possible input. In a non-deterministic automaton, an input can lead to one, more than one, or no transition for a given state. The powerset construction algorithm can transform any nondeterministic automaton into a (usually more complex) deterministic automaton with identical functionality. A finite state machine with only one state is called a \"combinatorial FSM\". It only allows actions upon transition into a state. This concept is useful in cases where a number of finite state machines are required to work together, and when it is convenient to consider a purely combinatorial part as a form of FSM to suit the design tools.[ 10] Mathematical model In accordance with the general classification, the following formal definitions are found: A deterministic finite state machine or acceptor deterministic finite state machine is a quintuple $ (\\Sigma ,S,s_{0},\\delta ,F) $, where: $ \\Sigma $ is the input alphabet (a finite, non-empty set of symbols). $ S $ is a finite, non-empty set of states. $ s_{0} $ is an initial state, an element of $ S $. $ \\delta $ is the state-transition function: $ \\delta :S\\times \\Sigma \\rightarrow S $ (in a nondeterministic finite automaton it would be $ \\delta :S\\times \\Sigma \\rightarrow {\\mathcal {P}}(S) $, i.e., $ \\delta $ would return a set of states). $ F $ is the set of final states, a (possibly empty) subset of $ S $. For both deterministic and non-deterministic FSMs, it is conventional to allow $ \\delta $ to be a partial function , i.e. $ \\delta (q,x) $ does not have to be defined for every combination of $ q\\in S $ and $ x\\in \\Sigma $. If an FSM $ M $ is in a state $ q $, the next symbol is $ x $ and $ \\delta (q,x) $ is not defined, then $ M $ can announce an error (i.e. reject the input). This is useful in definitions of general state machines, but less useful when transforming the machine. Some algorithms in their default form may require total functions . A finite state machine has the same computational power as a Turing machine that is restricted such that its head may only perform \"read\" operations, and always has to move from left to right. That is, each formal language accepted by a finite state machine is accepted by such a kind of restricted Turing machine, and vice versa.[ 15] TIPS: We can conclude that Turing machine is an generalization of finite state machine or finite state machine is a restrictive version of Turing machine . Optimization Main article: DFA minimization Optimizing an FSM means finding a machine with the minimum number of states that performs the same function. The fastest known algorithm doing this is the Hopcroft minimization algorithm .[ 17] [ 18] Other techniques include using an implication table , or the Moore reduction procedure . Additionally, acyclic FSAs can be minimized in linear time.[ 19] Usage In addition to their use in modeling reactive systems presented here, finite state machines are significant in many different areas, including electrical engineering , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , biology , mathematics , and logic . Finite state machines are a class of automata studied in automata theory and the theory of computation . In computer science, finite state machines are widely used in modeling of application behavior, design of hardware digital systems , software engineering , compilers , network protocols , and the study of computation and languages. Software applications The following concepts are commonly used to build software applications with finite state machines: Automata-based programming Event-driven finite-state machine Virtual finite-state machine State design pattern State machine replication Regular expression Finite state machines and compilers Finite automata are often used in the frontend of programming language compilers. Such a frontend may comprise several finite state machines that implement a lexical analyzer and a parser. Starting from a sequence of characters, the lexical analyzer builds a sequence of language tokens (such as reserved words, literals, and identifiers) from which the parser builds a syntax tree. The lexical analyzer and the parser handle the regular and context-free parts of the programming language's grammar.[ 22] Deterministic acyclic finite state automaton In computer science , a deterministic acyclic finite state automaton ( DAFSA ),[ 1] also called a directed acyclic word graph ( DAWG ; though that name also refers to a related data structure that functions as a suffix index[ 2] ) is a data structure that represents a set of strings , and allows for a query operation that tests whether a given string belongs to the set in time proportional to its length. Algorithms exist to construct and maintain such automata,[ citation needed ] while keeping them minimal . A DAFSA is a special case of a finite state recognizer that takes the form of a directed acyclic graph with a single source vertex (a vertex with no incoming edges), in which each edge of the graph is labeled by a letter or symbol, and in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge for each possible letter or symbol. The strings represented by the DAFSA are formed by the symbols on paths in the graph from the source vertex to any sink vertex (a vertex with no outgoing edges). In fact, a deterministic finite state automaton is acyclic if and only if it recognizes a finite set of strings .[ 1] application jieba jieba\u5206\u8bcd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6e90\u7801\u89e3\u6790 jieba\u5206\u8bcd\u7684\u539f\u7406","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Computation/Theory-of-computation/Automata-theory/Finite-state-machine/#wikipedia#finite-state#machine","text":"TIPS: In Chinese, Finite-state machine means \u6709\u7a77\u81ea\u52a8\u673a A finite-state machine ( FSM ) or finite-state automaton ( FSA , plural: automata ), finite automaton , or simply a state machine , is a mathematical model of computation .

Algorithms exist to construct and maintain such automata,[ citation needed ] while keeping them minimal . A DAFSA is a special case of a finite state recognizer that takes the form of a directed acyclic graph with a single source vertex (a vertex with no incoming edges), in which each edge of the graph is labeled by a letter or symbol, and in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge for each possible letter or symbol. The strings represented by the DAFSA are formed by the symbols on paths in the graph from the source vertex to any sink vertex (a vertex with no outgoing edges).

A Turing machine is a hypothetical machine thought of by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. Despite its simplicity, the machine can simulate ANY computer algorithm, no matter how complicated it is! Above is a very simple representation of a Turing machine . It consists of an infinitely-long tape which acts like the memory in a typical computer, or any other form of data storage. The squares on the tape are usually blank at the start and can be written with symbols. In this case, the machine can only process the symbols 0 and 1 and \" \" (blank), and is thus said to be a 3-symbol Turing machine . At any one time, the machine has a head which is positioned over one of the squares on the tape. With this head , the machine can perform three very basic operations: Read the symbol on the square under the head( read ). Edit the symbol by writing a new symbol or erasing it( write ). Move the tape left of right by one square so that the machine can read and edit the symbol on a neighbouring square( move ).

A simple program With the symbols \" 1 1 0 \" printed on the tape, let's attempt to convert the 1 s to 0 s and vice versa. This is called bit inversion , since 1 s and 0 s are bits in binary. This can be done by passing the following instructions to the Turing machine , utilising the machine's reading capabilities to decide its subsequent operations on its own. These instructions make up a simple program. Symbol read Write instruction Move instruction Blank None None 0 Write 1 Move tape to the right 1 Write 0 Move tape to the right The machine will first read the symbol under the head, write a new symbol accordingly, then move the tape left or right as instructed, before repeating the read-write-move sequence again. Let's see what this program does to our tape from the previous end point of the instructions: The current symbol under the head is 0 , so we write a 1 and move the tape right by one square. The symbol being read is now 1, so we write a 0 and move the tape right by one square: Similarly, the symbol read is a 1 , so we repeat the same instructions. Finally, a 'blank' symbol is read, so the machine does nothing apart from read the blank symbol continuously since we have instructed it to repeat the read-write-move sequence without stopping. In fact, the program is incomplete . How does the machine repeat the sequence endlessly, and how does the machine stop running the program? The program tells it to with the concept of a machine state . The machine state To complete the program, the state changes during the execution of the program on the machine must be considered. The following changes, marked in italics , must be added to our table which can now be called a state table : State Symbol read Write instruction Move instruction Next state State 0 Blank None None Stop state 0 Write 1 Move the tape to the right State 0 1 Write 0 Move the tape to the right State 0 We allocate the previous set of instructions to a machine state , so that the machine will perform those instructions when it is in the specified state. After every instruction, we also specify a state for the machine to transition to. In the example, the machine is redirected back to its original state, State 0 , to repeat the read-write-move sequence , unless a blank symbol is read.

Instead of a state table, the program can also be represented with a state diagram: From where the program was previously, instead of doing nothing and stopping after the machine encounters a blank symbol, we instruct it to move the tape left before transitioning to State 1 where it reverses the bit inversion process. Next, we invert the bits again, this time moving the tape left instead of right. Finally, a blank symbol is read, so we move the tape right to get back to where we started, and stop the program.

Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm , a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed. The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete \"cells\". The machine positions its \"head\" over a cell and \"reads\" or \"scans\" the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a \"finite table\" of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models allow symbol erasure or no writing), then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head), then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation.

Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm , a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed. The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete \"cells\". The machine positions its \"head\" over a cell and \"reads\" or \"scans\" the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a \"finite table\" of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models allow symbol erasure or no writing), then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head), then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation.

With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative: (1) Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is \"circular\" (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task) (2) does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol Note: \u4e0a\u9762\u4e24\u53e5\u4e2d\uff0cthat\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5b9a\u4ece\u662f\u4fee\u9970machine\u7684 Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general\u2014and in particular, the uncomputability of the Entscheidungsproblem ('decision problem').

I understand the notion of O(n) linear time, meaning that the size of the input affects the growth of the algorithm proportionally...and the same goes for, for example, quadratic time O(n^2) O(n^2) etc..even algorithms, such as permutation generators, with O(n!) times, that grow by factorials. For example, the following function is O(n) because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input n : f ( int n ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i ) printf ( \"%d\" , i ); } Similarly, if there was a nested loop, the time would be O(n^2) O(n^2) . But what exactly is O(log n) ? For example, what does it mean to say that the height of a complete binary tree is O(log n) ? I do know (maybe not in great detail) what Logarithm is, in the sense that: log_{10}{ 100} = 2 log_{10}{ 100} = 2 , but I cannot understand how to identify a function with a logarithmic time. A I cannot understand how to identify a function with a log time. The most common attributes of logarithmic running-time function are that: the choice of the next element on which to perform some action is one of several possibilities, and only one will need to be chosen. or the elements on which the action is performed are digits of n This is why, for example, looking up people in a phone book is O(log n). You don't need to check every person in the phone book to find the right one; instead, you can simply divide-and-conquer by looking based on where their name is alphabetically, and in every section you only need to explore a subset of each section before you eventually find someone's phone number. Of course, a bigger phone book will still take you a longer time, but it won't grow as quickly as the proportional increase in the additional size. We can expand the phone book example to compare other kinds of operations and their running time. We will assume our phone book has businesses \uff08\u4f01\u4e1a\uff09 (the \"Yellow Pages\") which have unique names and people (the \"White Pages\") which may not have unique names. A phone number is assigned to at most one person or business. We will also assume that it takes constant time to flip to a specific page. Here are the running times of some operations we might perform on the phone book, from best to worst: O(1) (best case): Given the page that a business's name is on and the business name, find the phone number. O(1) (average case): Given the page that a person's name is on and their name, find the phone number. O(log n): Given a person's name, find the phone number by picking a random point about halfway through the part of the book you haven't searched yet, then checking to see whether the person's name is at that point. Then repeat the process about halfway through the part of the book where the person's name lies. (This is a binary search for a person's name.) O(n): Find all people whose phone numbers contain the digit \"5\". O(n): Given a phone number, find the person or business with that number. O(n log n): There was a mix-up at the printer's office, and our phone book had all its pages inserted in a random order. Fix the ordering so that it's correct by looking at the first name on each page and then putting that page in the appropriate spot in a new, empty phone book. For the below examples, we're now at the printer's office. Phone books are waiting to be mailed to each resident or business, and there's a sticker on each phone book identifying where it should be mailed to. Every person or business gets one phone book. O(n log n): We want to personalize the phone book, so we're going to find each person or business's name in their designated copy, then circle their name in the book and write a short thank-you note for their patronage. O(n2): A mistake occurred at the office, and every entry in each of the phone books has an extra \"0\" at the end of the phone number. Take some white-out and remove each zero. O(n \u00b7 n!): We're ready to load the phonebooks onto the shipping dock. Unfortunately, the robot that was supposed to load the books has gone haywire: it's putting the books onto the truck in a random order! Even worse, it loads all the books onto the truck, then checks to see if they're in the right order, and if not, it unloads them and starts over. (This is the dreaded bogo sort .)

Every time the robot goes to load an original book, the factory printer makes a duplicate run of all the phonebooks! Fortunately, the robot's bug-detection systems are sophisticated enough that the robot doesn't try printing even more copies when it encounters a duplicate book for loading, but it still has to load every original and duplicate book that's been printed.

sacred rites\") is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being \"above\", \"below\", or \"at the same level as\" one another. A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior\uff08\u4e0a\u7ea7\uff09 or to one of one's subordinates\uff08\u4e0b\u5c5e\uff09, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Hierarchical links can extend \"vertically\" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path . All parts of the hierarchy that are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be \"horizontally\" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. This is akin to two co-workers or colleagues \uff08\u540c\u4e00\u5c42\uff09; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy.

The first requirement is also interpreted to mean that a hierarchy can have no circular relationships ; the association between two objects is always transitive . The second requirement asserts that a hierarchy must have a leader or root that is common to all of the objects. \u5173\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u539f\u6587\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u201ca hierarchy can have no circular relationships \u201d\uff0c\u201c circular relationships \"\u6307\u5411\u7684\u662f\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684 circle \uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6240\u60f3\u8981\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2ahierarchy\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u591f\u5b58\u5728\u73af\u7684\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u5730\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u5c42\u4e00\u5c42\u7684hierarchy\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5c31\u7b2c\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u539f\u8bdd\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4f7f\u7528relation\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5b83\u8868\u793a\u7684\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u80fd\u591f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a reflexive relation \uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5c31\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u73af\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u5c42\u4e00\u5c42\u7684hierarchy\u7ed3\u6784\u3002 Mathematical representation Mathematically, in its most general form, a hierarchy is a partially ordered set or poset .

A nested hierarchy or inclusion hierarchy is a hierarchical ordering of nested sets . The concept of nesting is exemplified in Russian matryoshka dolls \uff08\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5957\u5a03\uff09. Each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outer doll. The outer doll holds all of the inner dolls, the next outer doll holds all the remaining inner dolls, and so on. Matryoshkas represent a nested hierarchy where each level contains only one object, i.e., there is only one of each size of doll; a generalized nested hierarchy allows for multiple objects within levels but with each object having only one parent at each level . Nested hierarchies are the organizational schemes behind taxonomies \uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\uff09and systematic classifications. In many programming taxonomies and syntax models (as well as fractals in mathematics), nested hierarchies, including Russian dolls, are also used to illustrate the properties of self-similarity and recursion . Recursion itself is included as a subset of hierarchical programming, and recursive thinking can be synonymous with a form of hierarchical thinking and logic.

Hierarchy \u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u3002 A hierarchy (from the Greek hierarkhia , \"rule of a high priest\", from hierarkhes , \"president of sacred rites\") is an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being \"above\", \"below\", or \"at the same level as\" one another. A hierarchy can link entities either directly or indirectly, and either vertically or diagonally. The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior\uff08\u4e0a\u7ea7\uff09 or to one of one's subordinates\uff08\u4e0b\u5c5e\uff09, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Hierarchical links can extend \"vertically\" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a path . All parts of the hierarchy that are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be \"horizontally\" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again.

A nested hierarchy or inclusion hierarchy is a hierarchical ordering of nested sets . The concept of nesting is exemplified in Russian matryoshka dolls \uff08\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5957\u5a03\uff09. Each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outer doll. The outer doll holds all of the inner dolls, the next outer doll holds all the remaining inner dolls, and so on. Matryoshkas represent a nested hierarchy where each level contains only one object, i.e., there is only one of each size of doll; a generalized nested hierarchy allows for multiple objects within levels but with each object having only one parent at each level . Nested hierarchies are the organizational schemes behind taxonomies \uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\uff09and systematic classifications. In many programming taxonomies and syntax models (as well as fractals in mathematics), nested hierarchies, including Russian dolls, are also used to illustrate the properties of self-similarity and recursion .

Stream editing processes a file or files, in-place, without having to load the file(s) into a user interface. One example of such use is to do a search and replace on all the files in a directory, from the command line. 2) On Unix and related systems based on the C language , a stream is a source or sink of data, usually individual bytes or characters . Streams are an abstraction used when reading or writing files, or communicating over network sockets . The standard streams are three streams made available to all programs. 3) I/O devices can be interpreted as streams , as they produce or consume potentially unlimited data over time. NOTE: 2\u30013\u6240\u6307\u4e3astream-based IO\u3002 4) In object-oriented programming , input streams are generally implemented as iterators . NOTE: \u5982\u4f55\u5bf9iterator\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1f 5) In the Scheme language and some others, a stream is a lazily evaluated or delayed sequence of data elements. A stream can be used similarly to a list, but later elements are only calculated when needed. Streams can therefore represent infinite sequences and series . 6) In the Smalltalk standard library and in other programming languages as well, a stream is an external iterator . As in Scheme, streams can represent finite or infinite sequences. 7) Stream processing \u2014 in parallel processing , especially in graphic processing, the term stream is applied to hardware as well as software .

A bytestream is a sequence of bytes . Typically, each byte is an 8-bit quantity ( octets ), and so the term octet stream is sometimes used interchangeably. An octet may be encoded as a sequence of 8 bits in multiple different ways (see endianness ) so there is no unique and direct translation between bytestreams and bitstreams . Bitstreams and bytestreams are used extensively in telecommunications and computing .

Stream editing processes a file or files, in-place, without having to load the file(s) into a user interface. One example of such use is to do a search and replace on all the files in a directory, from the command line. 2) On Unix and related systems based on the C language , a stream is a source or sink of data, usually individual bytes or characters . Streams are an abstraction used when reading or writing files, or communicating over network sockets . The standard streams are three streams made available to all programs. 3) I/O devices can be interpreted as streams , as they produce or consume potentially unlimited data over time. NOTE: 2\u30013\u6240\u6307\u4e3astream-based IO\u3002 4) In object-oriented programming , input streams are generally implemented as iterators . NOTE: \u5982\u4f55\u5bf9iterator\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1f 5) In the Scheme language and some others, a stream is a lazily evaluated or delayed sequence of data elements. A stream can be used similarly to a list, but later elements are only calculated when needed. Streams can therefore represent infinite sequences and series . 6) In the Smalltalk standard library and in other programming languages as well, a stream is an external iterator . As in Scheme, streams can represent finite or infinite sequences. 7) Stream processing \u2014 in parallel processing , especially in graphic processing, the term stream is applied to hardware as well as software .

Relations can be used to solve problems such as determining which pairs of cities are linked by airline flights in a network, finding a viable order for the different phases of a complicated project, or producing a useful way to store information in computer databases.","title":"Definition of relation"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Relation/Relation/#relationshiprelation","text":"\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u6e05\u695arelationship\u548crelation\uff1a relationship\uff1a\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5e73\u65f6\u6240\u8bf4\u7684\u201c\u5173\u7cfb\u201d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u201c\u5927\u4e8e\u201d\u3001\u201c\u5c0f\u4e8e\u201d relation\uff1a\u5b83\u662fdiscrete math\u4e2d\u5bf9relationship\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aset\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u7684ordered-pair \u4e25\u683c\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e73\u65f6\u6240\u8bf4\u7684\u201c\u5173\u7cfb\u201d\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u201crelationship\u201d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\u8bed\u3002","title":"Relationship\u548crelation"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Relation/Relation/#wikipedia#finitary#relation","text":"Finitary relation \u7684\u542b\u4e49\u662f\u201c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u201d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u662f Binary relation \uff08\u4e8c\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3002","title":"wikipedia Finitary relation"},{"location":"Relation-structure-computation/Relation/Relation/#wikipedia#binary#relation","text":"In mathematics , a binary relation over two sets A and B is a set of ordered pairs ( a , b ), consisting of elements a of A and elements b of B .
